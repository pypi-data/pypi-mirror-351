This library creates [Shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) shapes designed to fit closely around a set of given points, and provides functionality to create a grid of points inside those shapes. 
This simplifies the problem of trying to find a shape that fits around all points, whilst allowing for gaps/multiple shapes to accomodate for situations where points may be clustered around a few areas, or handling points far outside a cluster. 

For examples of how to use the library, see the github readme [here](https://github.com/IGILtd/bounding_shape/blob/main/README.md).
