# faas-metric

`faas-metric` is a Python library that implements the **Fairness-Adjusted ASR Score (FAAS)** â€” a unified metric to evaluate **both accuracy and fairness** in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Based on the methodology proposed in the paper *ASR-FAIRBENCH: Measuring and Benchmarking Equity Across Speech Recognition Systems*, this library helps researchers and developers quantify model performance disparities across demographic groups using statistical fairness modeling.
