## 🚀 Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install easywinfetch
```

Or install directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Mkeko/Neofetch-for-windows.git
```

## 🖥️ Usage

Once installed, just run:

```bash
easywinfetch
```

That's it! You should see a nice ASCII logo alongside your system stats.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Tweak your display by editing the `config.yml` file. Some things you can adjust:

- Which ASCII art to show
- Where the logo appears (left/right)
- What system info shows up — and in what order
- Colors, labels, spacing
- Custom logos (if you're feeling artistic)

Example snippet from a config:

```yaml
ascii:
  selected_logo: "windows_11"
  colors:
    enabled: true
    primary: "blue"
    secondary: "cyan"

display:
  show_logo: true
  logo_position: left
  spacing: 2
```

More complete sample config is included in the repo.
