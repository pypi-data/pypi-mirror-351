# ü™ü Winfetch for Windows

A lightweight system info tool for Windows, inspired by **Neofetch**, but with Python vibes.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- ASCII art logos right in your terminal (because why not?)
- Configurable layout and data display
- Several prebuilt logos: Windows 10, Windows 11, Linux Tux, macOS, Python
- Control the info order and labels ‚Äî your way
- Terminal colors for easy visual parsing
- Easy to install, fun to tweak

---

## üöÄ Installation

Just pop this into your shell:

```bash
pip install winfetch
```

It should take care of all dependencies. If not, let us know!

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

Once installed, you can run Winfetch in two ways:

1. Using the command:
```bash
winfetch
```

2. Or by running the Python script:
```bash
python neofetch_win.py
```

That's it. You should see a nice ASCII logo alongside system stats.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Tweak your display by editing the `config.yml` file.

Some things you can adjust:

- Which ASCII art to show
- Where the logo appears (left/right)
- What system info shows up ‚Äî and in what order
- Colors, labels, spacing
- Custom logos (if you're feeling artistic)

Example snippet from a config:

```yaml
ascii:
  selected_logo: "windows_11"
  colors:
    enabled: true
    primary: "blue"
    secondary: "cyan"

display:
  show_logo: true
  logo_position: left
  spacing: 2
```

More complete sample config is included in the repo.
