# # The `ppo_step` function first computes the old action probabilities using the policy network.
# # These are detached from the current computation graph to prevent gradients from flowing into them during the policy update.

# # Then, it computes the value loss using the value network and the returns, and performs a value network update.

# After that, it enters a loop where it performs multiple policy updates.
# In each update, it computes the new action probabilities, and then the ratio of the new and old probabilities.
# This ratio is used to compute the policy loss, which is then used to update the policy network.

# The policy loss is computed in a way that encourages the new action probabilities to stay close to the old ones,
# which is the key idea behind PPO's objective of taking conservative policy updates.
