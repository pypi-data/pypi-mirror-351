class TextSceneAttentionFusion(nn.Module):
    """
    TextSceneAttentionFusion is an attention-based fusion mechanism to combine
    text sequences and 3D scene embeddings. The model computes attention scores
    for each text token with respect to the 3D scene to focus on specific parts
    of the text that are more relevant to the scene.

    Args:
        text_features (int): Dimension of the text embeddings.
        scene_features (int): Dimension of the scene embeddings.

    Forward Args:
        text (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape [batch_size, seq_len, text_features]
                             representing sequences of text embeddings.
        scene (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape [batch_size, depth, height, width, scene_features]
                              representing 3D scene embeddings.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Tensor of shape [batch_size, seq_len, scene_features]
                      representing the fused embeddings.
