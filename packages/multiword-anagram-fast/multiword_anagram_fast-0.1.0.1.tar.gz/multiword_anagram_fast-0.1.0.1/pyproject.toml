# For a non-workspace (single crate for lib and bindings, as sketched):
# This assumes Cargo.toml in multiword_anagram_fast/ is for the bindings module.
# The current `lib.rs` is in `multiword_anagram_fast_core`. A common setup is:
# multiword_anagram_fast/
#  Cargo.toml (for the rust extension module)
#  src/lib.rs (the PyO3 bindings, which use multiword_anagram_fast_core as a dependency)
#  multiword_anagram_fast/ (python files)
#  ...
# For now, let's assume `multiword_anagram_fast_core` itself is built as the cdylib.
# So, `maturin build` would be run from `multiword_anagram_fast_core` or configured to point there.
# If multiword_anagram_fast_core/Cargo.toml has `crate-type = ["cdylib"]` and pyo3 dependency,
# then maturin can build it directly.
# The manifest-path in pyproject.toml would point to multiword_anagram_fast_core/Cargo.toml
