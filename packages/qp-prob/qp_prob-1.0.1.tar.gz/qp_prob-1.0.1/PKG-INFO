`qp` is a python library for the storage and manipulation of tables of probability distributions.

### Features

- Read and write tables of probability distributions to/from file
- Parameterize probability distributions inferred from real data
- Convert between different methods of parameterizing probability distributions
- Perform statistical methods on many distributions at a time

### Links

- [Read the Docs](http://qp.readthedocs.io/)
- [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/qp-prob/)

## Installation

For a basic install of `qp`:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/LSSTDESC/qp.git
cd qp
pip install .

```

To install the developer environment:

```bash
# Clone the repo and enter it
git clone https://github.com/LSSTDESC/qp.git
cd qp

# Creating the environment from the YAML
conda env create -n qp_dev -f environment.yml

# Activate the environment
conda activate qp_dev

# Install qp in editable mode with dev dependencies
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

For more details see the [installation instructions](http://qp.readthedocs.io/user_guide/installation.html) on Read the Docs.

## Building the documentation locally

To build the documentation locally, start by making sure that you have the appropriate documentation packages installed:

```bash
pip install -e '.[docs]'

```

Once you have the appropriate packages, run the following lines of code to make the documentation:

```bash
cd docs/
make html

```

The HTML files will be generated in the `_build/` folder inside the `docs/` folder.
