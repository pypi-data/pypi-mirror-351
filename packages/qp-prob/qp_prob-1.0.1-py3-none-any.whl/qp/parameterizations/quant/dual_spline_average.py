    """Implementation of the "area-under-the-curve" using the average of
    the bounding splines fit to the CDF derivative.

    By using the difference between quantiles to solve for the area under the PDF, we can
    create an approximation of the original PDF. However, because we use a piecewise linear
    approximation for the continuous PDF, our approximated p(z) values will always be different
    that the original distribution. In practice they typically oscillate above and below the
    original curve as each calculation attempts to correct for over or undershooting of the prior
    calculation.

    If we fit two splines, one to the odd and one to the even approximated points, then take the
    average, the resulting average of those splines tend to fit the original distribution well.

    This constructor implements that algorithmic approach.

        that we know the p(z) value at 1 of those locations, we can solve
        for the unknown p(z) value at the other location.

        We approximate the area under the curve as a trapezoid with the following area:
        (q_i+1 - q_i) = (loc_i+1 - loc_i) * p(z_i) + (1/2) * (loc_i+1 - loc_i) * p(z_i+1 = p(z_i))
