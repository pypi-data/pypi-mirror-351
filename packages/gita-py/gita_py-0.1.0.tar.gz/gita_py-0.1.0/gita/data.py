        "Chapter 1 of Bhagavad Gita sets the scene where the two armies of Kauravas "
        "and Pandavas are juxtaposed in the field of Kurukshetra. Sanjay is granted divine vision "
        "by sage Ved Vyas to see the whole saga so that he can narrate it to Dhritrashtra, "
        "father of Duryodhan. Sanjay describes the expanse of the armies of both sides to Dhritrashtra "
        "and the valor of the mighty warriors on each side. Sanjay also mentions that victory is certain "
        "for the side where Shri Krishna is. Arjuna is mounted in a chariot controlled by Shri Krishna, "
        "the Lord of three lokas. Arjun is disheartened to see all his relatives standing in the opposite army "
        "as his adversaries, who until yesterday were merely friends. Due to his mental dilemma, Arjun first requests "
        "Shri Krishna to place his chariot between the two armies so that he can see all those who have stood against him. "
        "Dominated by 'Satgun' (the quality of love and affection), Arjuna drops his weapon and retreats to the back of the chariot, "
        "citing reasons that he cannot all of a sudden kill those whom he had until now considered his own. "
        "He even expresses a desire that if Duryodhan kills him right now, then the whole carnage would be averted. "
        "Arjun thus seeks the refuge of Shri Krishna."
    ),
    2: (
        "In this chapter, Arjun reiterates to Shree Krishna that he is unable to cope with his current situation,"
        "where he has to kill his elders and teachers. He refuses to take part in such a battle and requests Shree"
        "Krishna to be his spiritual teacher and guide him on the proper path of action. Then the Supreme Lord"
        "starts imparting divine knowledge to Arjun. He begins with the immortal-nature of the soul, which is"
        "eternal and imperishable. Death only destroys the physical body, but the soul continues its journey."
        "Just as a person discards his old clothes and adorns new ones, the soul "
        "keeps changing bodies from one lifetime to another."
        "The Lord then reminds Arjun that his social responsibility as a warrior is to fight for upholding righteousness."
        "He explains that performing one’s social duty is a virtuous act that can take him to the celestial abodes," 
        "while dereliction only leads to infamy and humiliation."
        "At first, Shree Krishna tries to motivate Arjun at a mundane level. Then he moves deeper and "
        "starts explaining to Arjun the Science of Work."
        "He asks Arjun to perform his deeds without any attachment to their fruits."
        "This science of working without desire for rewards is called the yog of the intellect or buddhi-yog."
        "He further advises that the intellect should be used to control the desire for rewards from work."
        "By working with such intent, the bondage-creating karmas get transformed into bondage-breaking "
        "karmas and a state beyond sorrows can be attained."
        "Arjun is curious to know more about those who are situated in divine consciousness. Shree Krishna, therefore, describes how"
        "persons who have attained transcendence are free from attachment, fear, and anger."
        "They are undisturbed and equipoised in every situation. With their senses subdued, they keep their minds always absorbed in God."
        "He also explains the progression of afflictions of the mind—such as greed, anger, lust, etc. and advises how these can be overcome."

    ),
    3: (
        "Shree Krishna expounds on karm yog or the yog of action in this chapter. He explains to Arjun that nobody "
        "can remain without action, even for a moment. Bound by their inherent modes of nature, all beings"
        "are always engaged in some work. Superior are those who practice karm yog and continue to"
        "work diligently to fulfill their responsibilities externally, but internally they are unattached to them. However, the hypocrites display"
        "external renunciation but internally dwell upon the objects of their senses."
        "Shree Krishna says that all living beings are an integral part of God’s creation and have roles and responsibilities to fulfill."
        "Vedas prescribe performing yajña to please the celestial gods, who in-return bestow material gains."
        "These yajñas cause rains to fall, which aids in the production of food grains for the sustenance of life on earth."
        "Those who live only for the delight of their senses and do not accept their responsibility in this cycle— are sinful and living in vain."
        "However, Shree Krishna says that when works or prescribed duties are performed as an obligation to God, they are also considered yajña (sacrifice)."
        "He then explains that unlike the rest of humankind, the enlightened souls are not obliged to fulfill their bodily responsibilities."
        "They are situated in knowledge of the self and execute higher responsibilities of the soul. However, they do not abandon their social duties,"
        "as it may create disharmony in the minds of the common people who look up to them for inspiration. Therefore, the wise continue to work without any"
        "personal motive only to set good examples for others to follow, else, the ignorant may abandon their prescribed duties prematurely. Shree Krishna" 
        "mentions one such example of the enlightened King Janak, who performed his earthly duties as an ideal king and father. Arjun then asks Shree Krishna"
        "why people commit sin, even when unwilling, as if by some force. Lord Krishna explains that lust alone is the sinful all-devouring enemy."
        "Similar to a fire that is covered by smoke or a mirror covered in dust, desire shrouds one’s knowledge and deludes the intellect."
        "In the end, Shree Krishna advises Arjun that by controlling the senses, mind, and intellect—one can slay this enemy" 
        "called desire, which is an embodiment of sin."
    ),
    4: (
        "To strengthen Arjun’s faith in the knowledge He is imparting, Shree Krishna reveals its pristine origin in this chapter."
        "He says, “Arjun, as you are my devotee and a dear friend, I am revealing this supreme science of yog to you. It is the same eternal"
        "science that I taught to the Sun God at the beginning of time. And in a continuous tradition, the same knowledgge; was passed"
        "to the saintly kings.” Arjun wonders how someone who is almost his age could exist so many eons ago. He asks Shree Krishna"
        "how is it possible that you gave this knowledge to the Sun God and the others so many years back in time."
        "Shree Krishna clarifies Arjun’s doubts and discloses the divine mystery of His descension. He says that"
        "although God is unborn and eternal, it is to establish dharma (the path of righteousness) that He descends on this earth by His Yogmaya power."
        "His birth and activities are divine and cannot get tainted by material imperfections. Once a devotee knows this secret and engages"
        "in devotion with great faith, he attains God and does not take birth in this world again."
        "Then Shree Krishna goes back to karm yog, the subject from the previous chapter. He continues to explain the nature of work and"
        "its three principles: action, in-action, and forbidden action."
        "He elaborates that the karm yogis, even while performing the most engaging task, are in the state of inaction and do not get entangled"
        "in the karmic reactions of such action. Knowing this: the ancient sages performed all their work as an act of"
        "sacrifice for the pleasure of God.  They were not affected by happiness, distress, success, or failure. He explains that when"
        "sacrifice is suitably dedicated, performed with proper knowledge and pure sentiments, then its remnants"
        "become like nectar. And by partaking such nectar, the devotees are cleansed of all impurities. Even the biggest"
        "sinner can cross over the ocean of material miseries by boarding this boat of eternal knowledge."
        "Shree Krishna says that such knowledge should be acquired only from a genuine spiritual master, who"
        "himself is God-realized. Being his Guru, Shree Krishna instructs Arjun to cut apart all doubts that have arisen in his heart with"
        "this sword of knowledge. He asks Arjun to now get up and perform his duty as a warrior."

        1.20: "At that time, the son of Pandu, Arjun, who had the insignia of Hanuman on the flag of his chariot, took up his bow. Seeing your sons arrayed against him, O King, Arjun then spoke the following words to Shree Krishna.",

        1.32: "O Krishna, I do not desire victory, kingdom, or the happiness accruing to it.",

        1.46: "It would be better if, with weapons in hand, the sons of Dhritarashtra kill me unarmed and unresisting on the battlefield.",
        1.47: "Sanjay said: Speaking thus, Arjun cast aside his bow and arrows, and sank into the seat of his chariot, his mind in distress and overwhelmed with grief."
