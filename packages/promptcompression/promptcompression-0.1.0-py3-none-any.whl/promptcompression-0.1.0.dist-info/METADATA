# LLM Prompt Compression

Are LLM's costing you too much in your application? This library will allow your prompts to have the minimum amount of text needed to convey what you want the LLM to do. This is perfect for prompts given by users, where they are constantly eating at your costs.

## What is this suitable for?

- Chat bots
- Local LLMS
- Input that does not need to have a strict structure
- Reducing text which reduces tokens which reduces $$$

## What is this not suitable for?
- Code
- Math
- Inputs that require structure, like reviewing a writing sample

## Install
This package is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/promptcompression/):
```
$ pip install promptcompression
```

## Usage
You use the ```compress()``` function, which has the argument ```text``` for the input prompt, and the optional argument ```savings``` which, when True, returns a tuple of the number of tokens saved, and the ratio of tokens saved by the original tokens.

Example:
```
from promptcompression import compress

prompt, tokens, ratio = compress("Summarize this text while sounding more natural. Please do not use contractions or an em dash to be more human-like.", savings = True)

print("Compressed text:", prompt)
print("Tokens saved:", tokens)
print(f"Compression ratio: {ratio:.2f}")

>>> Compressed text: summar text sound natur pleas dont use contract em dash humanlik
>>> Tokens saved: 13
>>> Compression ratio: 0.50
```
