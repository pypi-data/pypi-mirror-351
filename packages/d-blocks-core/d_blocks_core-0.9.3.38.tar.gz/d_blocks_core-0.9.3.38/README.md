# d-blocks: Bringing Teradata Code Under Control

## Overview

**d-blocks** is a open-source framework designed to bring **Teradata database code** under **Git-based version control** while seamlessly integrating with modern **CI/CD processes**. With d-blocks, organizations of all sizes--**from large enterprises to smaller teams**--can standardize and automate their daily database code workflows.

### Why d-blocks?

üöÄ **Gain full control over your Teradata DDLs** by leveraging Git as the single source of truth.<br>
üîÑ **Synchronize** Git branches with Teradata environments (**development, testing, production**).<br>
üì¶ **Deploy safely** from Git to database environments with various deployment strategies, including **incremental changes and rollback options**.<br>
‚öñÔ∏è **Compare environments and Git versions** to track changes and resolve discrepancies efficiently.<br>
ü§ñ **Automate package creation and deployments**, making release management easier.<br>
üåç **Leverage best practices and lessons learned** from **global teams** to improve your database development workflows.

d-blocks is not just a tool--it's a **community-driven initiative** that continuously evolves to incorporate the best strategies for database source control and release management.

## Documentation

Below are additional sections covering various aspects of d-blocks:

- [User Guidelines](docs/pages/user_guidelines.md)
- [Detail Use Cases](docs/pages/use_cases.md)
- [Road map & Updates](docs/pages/road_map.md)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick Start

### **1\. Prerequisites**

Before installing d-blocks, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.11+** installed ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **Access to a Teradata database** (e.g., local VM, cloud, or on-prem)

### **2. Installation**
Install d-blocks-core using pip:
```bash
pip install -U d-blocks-core
```

### **3. Clone Demo Repository**
To ensure a smooth testing experience, clone our demo project repository, which contains a small data warehouse definition, including:
- **DDL scripts to initialize the environment**
- **DDL scripts for database objects** (tables, views, indexes, etc.)

Clone the repository using Git client:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/d-blocks/d-blocks-demo.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file from [GitHub](https://github.com/d-blocks/d-blocks-demo.git), but we encourage users to use Git client for better version control and easy updates.

### **4. Configure and Test the Utility**
After cloning the demo repository, configure and test the utility by following these steps:

#### **Edit the Configuration File**
1. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the demo repository:
   ```bash
   cd d-blocks-demo
   ```
2. Locate the configuration file **dblocks.toml** in the root directory and edit it.
3. The configuration file looks like this:
   ```toml
   config_version = "1.0.0"

   # Configuration for our demo environment called d-blocks-demo
   [ environments.d-blocks-demo ]

   # Set authentication info for your machine
   host = "your_machine_host"
   username = "your_user"
   password = "your_password"        # We keep password here for demo purposes.
                                     # It is strongly recommended to define user 
                                     # password via environment variable.

   extraction.databases = [ "dev_admin" ]   # This is the root database - under 
                                            # it, we create the demo environment
   git_branch = "master"
   writer.target_dir="./teradata-code"
   tagging_rules = [ "{{env}}%" ]

   # Code in Git is typically environment agnostic - it does not contain 
   # any specific environment values like database prefixes. Based on 
   # tagging_rules, we replace any database prefix "dev" with {{env}}
   # and contrary once deploying agnostic code from Git to d-blocks-demo
   # environment we replace {{env}} by "dev" value.
   [ environments.d-blocks-demo.tagging_variables ]
   env = "dev"
   ```
4. Follow the instructions in the configuration file and fill in the correct **host name, user name, and database password**.

#### **Test the Configuration and Database Connection**
Once you've updated the configuration, verify that everything is set up correctly:
```bash
d-bee cfg-check
d-bee env-test-connection d-blocks-demo
```
If these commands run successfully, your environment is ready to use **d-blocks** for database management.

### **5. Basic Usage**

The demo project contains script (env-init/demo_env_init.sql) that will create database structures in demo environment under demo_user database. Once staying in root folder of demo project run the follwoing initilization:

```bash
d-bee quickstart
```

Deploy database structures from Git to your environment:

```bash
d-bee env-deploy --if-extsts drop dev
```

Synchronize Git with your development Teradata environment:

```bash
d-bee env-extract dev
```

## Typical Use Cases

d-blocks helps projects solve common database source control and deployment challenges, including:

- **Version-controlling Teradata code** and integrating it into existing Git workflows.
- **Managing multiple environments (development, testing, production)** and ensuring consistency.
- **Deploying incremental changes** while minimizing risks.
- **Comparing database states** across environments and branches.
- **Automating routine database deployment processes** with CI/CD pipelines.
