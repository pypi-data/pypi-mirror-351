## Installation

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### As a Python Library

```python
# File operations
from shellama import file_ops

# List files in a directory
files = file_ops.list_files('/path/to/directory')

# Read a file
content = file_ops.read_file('/path/to/file.md')

# Write to a file
file_ops.write_file('/path/to/file.md', 'New content')

# Directory operations
from shellama import dir_ops

# Create a directory
dir_ops.create_directory('/path/to/new/directory')

# Shell commands
from shellama import shell

# Execute a shell command
result = shell.execute_command('ls -la')

# Git operations
from shellama import git_ops

# Get git status
status = git_ops.get_status('/path/to/repo')
```

### As a REST API Service

SheLLama is designed to run as a standalone REST API service that communicates with the APILama gateway:

```bash
# Start the SheLLama API server
python -m shellama.app --port 8002 --host 127.0.0.1
```

Using environment variables:

```bash
export PORT=8002
export HOST=127.0.0.1
export DEBUG=False
python -m shellama.app
```

Or using the Makefile:

```bash
make run PORT=8002 HOST=127.0.0.1
```

### Environment Variables

SheLLama uses the following environment variables for configuration:

- `PORT`: The port to run the server on (default: 8002)
- `HOST`: The host to bind to (default: 127.0.0.1)
- `DEBUG`: Enable debug mode (default: False)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (default: INFO)
- `LOG_FILE`: Log file path (default: shellama.log)
- `SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for secure operations

You can set these variables in a `.env` file or pass them directly when starting the server.

## Development

### Setting Up the Development Environment

SheLLama supports multiple dependency management tools for flexibility. Choose the approach that works best for your workflow.

### Managing Services

The Makefile provides several targets to help manage services and Docker containers:

```bash
# Start the SheLLama service
make run PORT=8002 HOST=0.0.0.0

# Start the Ansible testing environment
make ansible-test-env-up

# Stop all services, Docker containers, and free up ports
make stop
```

The `stop` target will:
- Stop all running Python processes for SheLLama and APILama on standard ports (8002, 8080, 9002, 9080, 19002, 19080)
- Stop and remove all Docker containers related to the PyLama ecosystem
- Stop the Ansible testing environment
- Check for any processes still using the relevant ports

#### Using pip and venv (Standard)

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

#### Using Poetry

```bash
# Install dependencies with Poetry
poetry install

# Activate the Poetry virtual environment
poetry shell

# Run a command without activating the environment
poetry run python -m shellama.app
```

#### Using Pipenv

```bash
# Install dependencies with Pipenv
pipenv install --dev

# Activate the Pipenv virtual environment
pipenv shell

# Run a command without activating the environment
pipenv run python -m shellama.app
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_file_ops.py

# Run with coverage report
python -m pytest --cov=shellama tests/
```

### Error Handling and Debugging

SheLLama includes a comprehensive error handling system that provides standardized error responses across the application. This system categorizes errors by type and severity, making it easier to identify and resolve issues.

#### Error Categories

- **Validation Errors**: Issues with input validation
- **Permission Errors**: Access denied or insufficient permissions
- **File System Errors**: Problems with file or directory operations
- **Git Errors**: Issues with Git operations
- **Shell Errors**: Problems executing shell commands
- **Configuration Errors**: Issues with application configuration
- **External Service Errors**: Problems with external services

#### Debug Window

The debug window provides real-time debugging information that can be accessed through the API. It captures detailed information about application operations, errors, and performance metrics.

Features include:

- **Filtering**: Filter debug entries by level, category, or source
- **Real-time Capture**: Capture debugging information as it happens
- **API Access**: Access debug information through REST API endpoints
- **Configurable**: Enable or disable debugging at runtime

```python
# Using the debug window in code
from shellama.debug_window import add_debug_entry, DebugLevel, DebugCategory

# Add a debug entry
add_debug_entry(
    message="Processing file operation",
    level=DebugLevel.INFO,
    category=DebugCategory.FILE_OPERATIONS,
    details={"filename": "example.txt", "operation": "read"}
)
```

### Ansible Integration Tests

SheLLama includes a comprehensive suite of Ansible tests that verify the functionality of all API endpoints. These tests ensure that the service works correctly and can be integrated with other systems.

#### Ansible Testing Environment

A Docker-based Ansible testing environment is available for testing SheLLama and its integration with other PyLama components. This environment includes:

- **Ansible Controller**: Container with Ansible and testing tools installed
- **Service Targets**: Containers for each PyLama component
- **Mock Services**: Containers that simulate services for testing integration

To use the Ansible testing environment:

```bash
# Build the testing environment
make ansible-test-env-build

# Start the testing environment
make ansible-test-env-up

# Run tests in the environment
make ansible-test-env-run

# Open a shell in the controller container
make ansible-test-env-shell

# Stop the testing environment
make ansible-test-env-down
```

See the `test_markdown/devops_tools/ANSIBLE_TESTING.md` file for more detailed information about the Ansible testing environment.

#### Docker Testing Environment

A Docker testing environment is available for testing SheLLama without requiring the actual services to be running:

```bash
# Build and run all tests
./run_docker_tests.sh --build --run-tests

# Start in interactive mode
./run_docker_tests.sh --interactive

# Run only Git operations tests
./run_docker_tests.sh --test-git

# Stop containers when done
./run_docker_tests.sh --stop
```

See the `DOCKER_TESTING.md` file for more detailed information about the Docker testing environment.

#### Test Markdown Directory

A comprehensive test markdown directory is included in the project to support testing of all SheLLama functionality:

```
/test_markdown/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ file_operations/       # For testing file handling functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ git_operations/        # For testing Git functionality
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shell_commands/        # For testing shell command execution
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ devops_tools/          # For testing DevOps tools integration
```

This directory contains example files for testing various aspects of SheLLama, including file operations, Git functionality, shell command execution, and DevOps tools integration. See the `test_markdown/README.md` file for more information.

```bash
# Run all Ansible tests (requires APILama and SheLLama to be running)

./run_ansible_tests.sh --skip-health-check

# Show help
./run_ansible_tests.sh --help
```

#### Test Reports

The Ansible tests generate a comprehensive HTML report that provides detailed information about the test results. The report includes:

- Test summary with overall status
- Detailed results for each test category (file operations, directory operations, shell operations, git operations)
- Assertions verification
- Timestamps and environment information

Test reports are saved in the `ansible_tests/logs/` directory with a timestamp in the filename.

The Ansible tests cover:
- File operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Directory operations (create, list, delete)
- Shell command execution
- Git operations (comprehensive):
  - Repository initialization
  - Status checking
  - Adding and committing files
  - Branch creation and checkout
  - Merging branches
  - Viewing commit history
- Error handling (edge cases):
  - Non-existent directories and files
  - Invalid Git repositories and branches
  - Invalid shell commands
  - Proper error response validation
- Health check endpoints

#### Testing through APILama Gateway

The Ansible tests are designed to test SheLLama through the APILama gateway, which is the recommended way to access SheLLama in production. The APILama gateway adds the `/api/shellama` prefix to all SheLLama endpoints.

To run the tests, both the APILama gateway and SheLLama service must be running:

```bash
# In one terminal, start the APILama gateway
cd ../apilama
make run

# In another terminal, start the SheLLama service
cd ../shellama
make run

# Then run the tests
make ansible-test
```

Test results are logged to `ansible_tests/logs/` for debugging and auditing purposes.

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code with Black
black shellama tests

# Lint code with Flake8
flake8 shellama tests

# Type checking with MyPy
mypy shellama
```

### Docker Development

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t shellama .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8002:8002 shellama
```
