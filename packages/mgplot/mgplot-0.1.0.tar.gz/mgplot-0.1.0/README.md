mgplot
======

Description
-----------
mgplot is an open-source python frontend for the matplotlib 
package to:
1. produce time-series charts that can be a little difficult or 
   tricky to produce directly, 
2. finalise (or publish) charts with titles, xlabels, ylabels,
   etc., all while 
3. minimising code duplication, and maintaining a common plot
   style or look-and-feel.

Import
------
```
import mgplot as mg
```
