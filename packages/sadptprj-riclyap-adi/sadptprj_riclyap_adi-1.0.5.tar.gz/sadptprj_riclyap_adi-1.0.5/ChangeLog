v1.1
----

* sparse non sparse multiplication in pru
* sparse non sparse multiplication in pru
* sparse no sparse exception catch
* added \_\_all\_\_ to lau
* bug in app\_smw\_inv
* doc work for local sphinx
* upd docs
* upd docs
* now the residual is None unless it is computed
* only resnorms for stats - otherwise too memory consuming
* added handling for convergence statistics in krylov branch of solve\_smw
* added dense branch in inv sqrt mass
* put some things right
* added krypy to sadpnt\_smw - unittest pass
* now app\_smw\_inv can resort to krypy - unittest pass
* smw and krypy work - unit test pass - need to pass parameters
* new branch in lau.app\_smw\_inv for krylov case
* renaming of a function
* caching of alu in smw - sparse u in smw - (old) unittest pass
* renamed lau.matvec\_densesparse to lau.mm\_dnssps -- troubles ahead
* dense sparse improved in lau.app\_smw
