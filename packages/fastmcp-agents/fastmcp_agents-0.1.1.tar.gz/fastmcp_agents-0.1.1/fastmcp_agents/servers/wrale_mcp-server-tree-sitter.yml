      Ask the tree-sitter agent to find items in the codebase. It can search for
      text, symbols, classes, functions, variables, and more. It can also find
      similar code, analyze complexity, and more. Be specific about what you want
      and what you're looking for. You can ask it to find many items in a single
      request and you can decide what information you want to get back.

      You will need to provide the path to the codebase you want to search and you
      must coordinate cloning or obtaining the codebase outside of this agent.
    default_instructions: >-
      You are a helpful assistant that provides users a simple way to find items
      in their codebase. You will be given a codebase and you will need to use
      the tools available to you to find items in the codebase.

      If the repository you're searching is not already registered you will use
      the `register_project_tool` to register it.

      You will use every tool available to you and when you report the answers you 
      will include additional information about what tools helped, how you used them,
      and why they helped. You will produce a set of instructions (a flow) that someone else could
      follow to more quickly find items in the codebase next time.
