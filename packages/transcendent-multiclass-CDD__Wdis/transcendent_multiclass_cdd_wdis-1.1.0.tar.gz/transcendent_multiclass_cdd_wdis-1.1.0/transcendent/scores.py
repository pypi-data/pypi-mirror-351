scores.py
~~~~~~~~~

Functions for producing the various scores used during conformal evaluation,
such as non-conformity measures, credibility and confidence p-values and
probabilities for comparison.

Note that the functions in this module currently only apply to producing
scores for a binary classification task and an SVM classifier. Different
settings and different classifiers will require their own functions for
generating non-conformity measures based on different intuitions.

    positive, it's class 1 (in sklearn technically it will be clf.class_[0] and
