# Fizz Buzz Badgers 

This is the FizzBuzz Program from the earlier lesson. 
The rules for the program are: 

For the numbers from 1 to 30:

* If the number is evenly divisible by 5, print '🦡 badger'
* If the number is evenly divisible by 3, print '🍄 mushroom'
* If the number is evenly divisible by 15, print '🐍 snake!'
* If it is divisible by neither, print the number.

Your job is to modify only one line -- the one with range() 
-- so that the program only prints '🦡 badger'

Your program should print 4 badgers.
