# Metadata

The Syllabus creation will automatically create several values by analysing your code or filenames, and you 
can over ride these by setting metadata in various. If you do not set metadata, these values are automatic: 

* name: Based on the lesson file name
* display: Set to true if your pytho code references turtle, pygame, or a few other GUI libraries 
* lesson: The file that has a `.md` extension
* exercise: The file that has a `.py` extension, or other code file extension


You can also set these values in these places: 

* A frontmatter block in the `.md` file
* The cell metadata in a jupyter notebook.
* YAMLish comment lines in the python file
