# 21: Build the Machine-Payable Web [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/21dotco/two1-python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/21dotco/two1-python)

![21 logo](docs/img/21_banner.png "21")

21 is an open source Python library and command line interface for
quickly building machine-payable web services. It allows you to
accomplish three major tasks:

  - Get bitcoin on any device
  - Add bitcoin micropayments to any Django or Flask app
  - Earn bitcoin on every HTTP request

The package includes:

 - an HD wallet to securely manage your bitcoin
 - crypto and bitcoin libraries to build bitcoin/blockchain applications
 - a [micropayment-channels](https://21.co/learn/intro-to-micropayment-channels/) client and server
 - commands for mining, buying, and earning bitcoin, as well as requesting it from the 21 faucet
 - tools for publishing machine-payable endpoints to the [21 Marketplace](https://21.co/mkt)
 - containers that allow your machine to sell machine resources for bitcoin

and much more.

## Security

_Please note that the 21 software is in beta_. To protect the security
of your systems while using 21, we highly recommend you install the
software on a device other than your main laptop (e.g. 21 Bitcoin
Computer, an old laptop, or an Amazon Virtual Machine) while the
product is still in beta. You can read more security-related
information [here](https://21.co/learn/security/). Please send an
email to [security@21.co](mailto://support@21.co) regarding any issue
concerning security.

## Installation
[Create an account](https://21.co) or install the library and CLI
(python3.4+ is required):

``` bash
$ curl https://21.co | sh
```

`two1` can also be installed via pip:

``` bash
$ sudo pip3 install two1
```

Start with the command line tool:

``` bash
$ 21 help
```

Then read the [Introduction to 21](https://21.co/learn/intro-to-21/) guide
and the `two1`
[documentation](https://21.co/learn/#reference-21-library).

## Developers
To edit and run the two1 source code:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/21dotco/two1-python.git
$ cd two1-python/
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt  # Install the requirements
$ pip3 install -e .  # Install 21 as an editable python library
```

Your changes to the source will now be reflected in your system
installation in real-time.

## Docker
You can pull [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images with
`two1` pre-installed from the
[21 Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/21dotco/two1).

``` bash
$ docker pull 21dotco/two1
```

Then run the latest base image:

``` bash
