# Representing a Vector

# In nengo, ensembles of neurons represent information. In this model,
# you will represent a two-dimensional vector with a single ensemble of
# LIF (leaky integrate-and-fire) neurons. Though this is a case of
# two-dimensional vector representation, but the ideas naturally
# generalize to any number of dimensions.

# This model has paramenters as described in the book, with the neurons
# in the ensemble having two dimensions. Since the default max rates in
# Nengo 2.0 are (200, 400), so you have to explicitly specify them to be
# (100, 200) to create the same model as in the book. The default values
# of tauRC, tauRef, intercepts, radius and expected noise in Nengo 2.0
# are same as those mentioned in the book.

# Press the play button to run the simulation.
# The cos and sin graphs show the two dimensional input provided to the
# ensemble and the top right graph shows the the decoded estimate of this
# two dimensional input. The graph on bottom right shows the XY-value i.e.,
# the state represented by one dimension of the ensemble vs the state
# represented by the other dimension.

# Grab and move the sliders to manually control the input to the neurons.
