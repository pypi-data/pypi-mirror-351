# Structured Representations using SPA

# Now we will build the model again, using the spa (semantic pointer
# architecture) package built into Nengo 2.0. You will see that using the spa
# package considerably simplifies model construction and visualization through
# nengo_gui.

# Press the play button to run the simulation.
# The graphs A and B show the semantic pointer representations in objects A and
# B respectively. Graphs labelled C show the result of the convolution operation
# (left - shows the semantic pointer representation in object C, right - shows
# the similarity with the vectors in the vocabulary). The graphs labelled Sum
# show the sum of A and B as represented by the object Sum (left - shows the
# semantic pointer representation in Sum, right - shows high similarity with
# vectors A and B).
