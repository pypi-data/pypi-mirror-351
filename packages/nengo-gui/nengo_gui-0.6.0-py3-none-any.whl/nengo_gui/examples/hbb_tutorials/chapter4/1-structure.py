# Structured Representations

# This model shows a method for constructing structured representations
# using semantic pointers (high-dimensional neural vector representations). It
# uses a convolution network to bind two Semantic Pointers and a Sum
# network to cojoin two semantic pointers.

# **Note: This model can be simplified if built using the spa (semantic
# pointer architecture) package in Nengo 2.0. This method is shown in the
# spa_structure.py file in the same folder.

# This model has parameters as described in the book, with the ensembles
# having 20 dimensions and 300 neurons each. You will use the
# 'nengo.networks.CircularConvolution' class in Nengo 2.0 to compute the
# convolution (or binding) of two semantic pointers A and B.

# Since the collection of named vectors in a space forms a kind of "vocabulary"
# as described in the book, you will create a vocabulary to build structured
# representations out of it.

# Press the play button to run the simulation.
# The value graphs show the value of individual components of their respective
# ensembles. They show the same information as the "value" graphs in the
# Interactive Plots in Nengo 1.4 GUI as described in the book.

# Sum looks similar to B and A, whereas C looks very dissimilar because it
# is the result of a circular convolution.
