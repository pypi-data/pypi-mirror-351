# Routed Sequencing with Cleanup Memory

# This model extends the routed sequencing model by creating a scalar ensemble
# 'cleanup' as explained in the book. We project the 'state' on to the
# 'cleanup' ensemble using a transformation matrix 'pd', specified by the
# vocabulary vector 'A'. This implies that each component of the state vector
# (i.e., the cortical element) is multiplied by the corresponding component of
# the 'A' vector and summed to produce a one dimensional quantity represented by
# the 'cleanup' ensemble. This operation is similar to the dot product of the
# state vector and the vocabulary vector 'A'.

# This model has parameters as described in the book, with a one dimensional
# cleanup ensemble consisting of 100 neurons.

# Press the play button in the visualizer to run the simulation.
# The graph on the bottom-left shows the semantic pointer representation of the
# values stored in the state and the response of the cleanup population is shown
# in the graph on the bottom-right. The graph on the top-right shows the utility
# (similarity) of the current basal ganglia input (i.e., state) with the
# possible vocabulary vectors. Since the cleanup operation is similar to a dot
# product between the state of the cortical element (state) and the defined
# vocabulary vector 'A', the value of the cleanup population rises only when the
# state (top-right graph) is 'A'.
