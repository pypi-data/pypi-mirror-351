# Nonlinear Transformations

# The real world is filled with non-linearities and so dealing
# with them often requires nonlinear computation. This model shows
# how to compute nonlinear functions using Nengo 2.0. The two nonlinear
# functions demonstrated in this model are 'multiplication' and 'squaring'.

# The parameters of the model are as described in the book. The model has five
# ensembles: two input ensembles (ens_X and ens_Y), a 2D combined ensemble (vector2D),
# and the output ensembles result_square and result_product which store the
# square and product of the inputs respectively.

# Two varying scalar values are used for the two input signals that drive
# activity in ensembles A and B. For multiplication, we project both
# inputs independently into a 2D space, and then decode a nonlinear
# transformation of that space (i.e., the product) into an ensemble
# (result_product). The model also squares the value of the first input
# (input_X) encoded in an ensemble (ens_X), in the output of another ensemble
# (result_square).

# The two functions product(x) and square(x) are defined to serve the same
# purpose as entering the expressions in the "Expression" field in the
# "User-defined Function" dialog box in Nengo 1.4 as described in the book.

# Press the play button to run the simulation.
# The input signals chosen clearly show that the model works well.
# The result_product graph shows the product of the input_X & input_Y, and
# the result_square graph shows the squre of input_X. You can see in the graphs
# that when input_X is zero, both the product and the square are also zero. You
# can use the sliders to change the input values provided by the input_X and
# input_Y nodes to test the model.

# To inspect any values in the graphs, you can hover your mouse over the graph
# and the x and t values will be displayed near the axis.  This can be easier
# when you pause the simulation.  When you pause, you can also drag the blue
# box at the bottom of the screen to slide backwards and forward through time.
