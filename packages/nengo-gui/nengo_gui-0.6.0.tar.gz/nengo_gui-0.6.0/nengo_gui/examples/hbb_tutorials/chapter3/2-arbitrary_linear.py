# Arbitrary Linear Transformation

# This model shows that any linear transformation between ensembles can be
# easily computed by selecting an appropriate value for the "transform". It
# provides an example of computing linear transformations using vector
# representations.

# Network diagram:  [input - 2D] ---> (x - 2d) ---> (z - 3D)
# A two-dimensional input signal is first fed into a two-dimensional neuronal
# ensemble x, which then projects it on to another three-dimensional ensemble z.

# This model contains the parameters as described in the book. Setting the
# transform equal to the 'weight_matrix' is analogous to entering the weights
# in the "2 to 3 Coupling Matrix" window in Nengo 1.4 GUI as described in the
# book.

# Press the play button to run the simulation.
# The graphs show a two-dimesional input linearly projected on to a
# two-dimensional ensemble of neurons (ens_X), which further linearly projects it on
# to a three-dimesional neuronal ensemble (ens_Z). You can use the sliders to change
# the input values provided by the input node.
