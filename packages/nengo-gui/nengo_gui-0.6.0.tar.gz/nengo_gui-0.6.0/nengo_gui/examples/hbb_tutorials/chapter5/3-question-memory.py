# Question Answering with Memory

# This model shows a form of question answering with memory. It binds two
# features (color and shape) by circular convolution and stores them in a memory
# population. It then provides a cue to the model at a later time to
# determine the feature bound to that cue by deconvolution. This model exhibits
# better cognitive ability since the answers to the questions are provided at a
# later time and not at the same time as the questions themselves.

# **Note: A simplified method of building the model using the spa (semantic
# pointer architecture) package in Nengo 2.0 is shown in the
# spa_question-memory.py file in the same folder.

# This model has parameters as described in the book, with memory population
# having 1000 neurons over 20 dimensions. The memory population is capable of
# storing a vector over time and it uses an integrator network to do so as
# discussed in the book.

# The color input presented to the model is RED and then BLUE for 0.25 seconds
# each before being turned off. In the same way the shape input is CIRCLE and
# then SQUARE for 0.25 seconds each. Thus, when you run the model, it will start
# by binding RED and CIRCLE for 0.25 seconds and then binding BLUE and SQUARE
# for 0.25 seconds. The cue for deconvolving bound semantic pointers will be
# turned off for 0.5 seconds and then starts cycling through CIRCLE, RED,
# SQUARE, and BLUE within each second. The model will be able to determine the
# correct answer using the cue, even when the color and shape inputs have been
# turned off.

# Press the play button to run the simulation.
# The graphs of shape, color, bound and memory show that first RED * CIRCLE and
# then BLUE * SQUARE are convolved (bound) and loaded into the memory population,
# so after 0.5 seconds the memory represents the superposition
# RED * CIRCLE + BLUE * SQUARE. The last plot shows that the output is most
# similar to the semantic pointer bound to the current cue. For example, when
# the cue is CIRCLE, the output is most similar to RED.  Again, this is much
# easier to see in the spa_question-memory.py example.
