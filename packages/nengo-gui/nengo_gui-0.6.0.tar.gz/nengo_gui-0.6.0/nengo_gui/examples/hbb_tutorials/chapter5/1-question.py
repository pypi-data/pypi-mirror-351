# Question Answering

# This model shows a simple form of question answering. The goal of
# this model is to build a network that will output answers to questions
# based on supplied statements as described in the book. You will bind
# two features (color and shape) by circular convolution. Then you will provide
# a cue to the model to determine either one of the features by deconvolution.

# **Note: Simplified method of building the model using the spa
# (semantic pointer architecture) package in Nengo 2.0 is shown
# in the spa_question.py file in the same folder.

# This model has parameters as described in the book, with the ensembles having
# 300 neurons in 20 dimensions and the bind and unbind networks having 70
# neurons per dimension. The model relies on SPA (Semantic Pointer Architecture)
# methods for charachterizing representation, transformation and control.

# Depending on your computer, this model may run slowly which can be avoided by
# several ways as discussed in the book. In order to run the model in direct
# mode (explained in the book), the parameter 'neuron_type' should be set to
# nengo.Direct() while creating the ensembles.

# As mentioned in the book, the color input will alternate every 0.5 seconds
# between RED and BLUE. In the same way the shape input alternates between
# CIRCLE and SQUARE. Thus, the model will bind alternatingly RED * CIRCLE and
# BLUE * SQUARE for 0.5 seconds each. In parallel you will ask a question from
# the model by providing a cue which will be used for deconvolving bound
# semantic pointers to determine an answer. For example, when the cue is CIRCLE
# the model will respond with RED. The cue will cycle through CIRCLE, RED,
# SQUARE, and BLUE within one second.

# Press the play button to run the simulation.
# The graph labelled "output" shows that the output is most similar to the semantic
# pointer bound to the current cue. For example, when RED and CIRCLE are being
# bound and the cue is CIRCLE, the output is most similar to RED.  This is much
# easier to see in the spa_question.py version.
