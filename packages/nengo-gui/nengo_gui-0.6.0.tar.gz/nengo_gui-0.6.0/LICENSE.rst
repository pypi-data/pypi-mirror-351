     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                                Preamble

      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
    the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
    your programs, too.

      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
    rights.

      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the software.

      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
    authors' reputations.

      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.

                        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

      0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
    along with the Program.

    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
        part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
        parties under the terms of this License.

        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
        notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
        a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
        these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
        License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
        does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
        the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Program.

    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.

      3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
        cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
        customarily used for software interchange; or,

        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
        to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
        allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
        received the program in object code or executable form with such
        an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
    itself accompanies the executable.

    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

      4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.

      5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Program or works based on it.

      6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
    this License.

      7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.

    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.

    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.

      8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

      9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
    Foundation.

      10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY

      11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

      12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Contributor Assignment Agreement
********************************

Based on Harmony (HA-CAA-I-ANY) Version 1.0, with minor changes.

Nengo GUI Individual Contributor Assignment Agreement
=====================================================

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Nengo GUI, a product of
Applied Brain Research ("We" or "Us").

This contributor agreement (the "Agreement") documents the rights
granted by contributors to Us.

By adding your name to the CONTRIBUTORS.rst file at
<https://github.com/nengo/nengo-gui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.rst>
you are agreeing to be bound by the Agreement in full.

You agree to inform Us in the relevant pull request(s) if You do not own
the Copyright to the entire Submission. We will initiate an IP review
with You to determine the eligibility of the Submission before merging
the pull request.

This is a legally binding document, so please read it carefully before
agreeing to it. The Agreement may cover more than one software project
managed by Us.

1. Definitions
--------------

"You" means the individual who Submits a Contribution to Us.

"Contribution" means any work of authorship that is Submitted by You
to Us in which You own or assert ownership of the Copyright.

"Copyright" means all rights protecting works of authorship owned or
controlled by You, including copyright, moral and neighboring rights,
as appropriate, for the full term of their existence including any
extensions by You.

"Material" means the work of authorship which is made available by Us
to third parties. When this Agreement covers more than one software
project, the Material means the work of authorship to which the
Contribution was Submitted. After You Submit the Contribution, it may
be included in the Material.

"Submit," "Submission" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
communication (including any and all Contributions and works of
authorship) sent to Us or our representatives, including but not limited
to electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue
tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Us for the
purpose of discussing and improving the Material, but excluding
communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in
writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

"Submission Date" means the date on which You Submit a Contribution to
Us.

"Effective Date" means the date You execute this Agreement or the date
You first Submit a Contribution to Us, whichever is earlier.

2. Grant of Rights
------------------

2.1 Copyright Assignment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(a) At the time the Contribution is Submitted, You assign to Us all
    right, title, and interest worldwide in all Copyright covering the
    Contribution; provided that this transfer is conditioned upon
    compliance with Section 2.3.

(b) To the extent that any of the rights in Section 2.1(a) cannot be
    assigned by You to Us, You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide,
    exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, irrevocable license under
    such non-assigned rights, with rights to sublicense through
    multiple tiers of sublicensees, to practice such non-assigned
    rights, including, but not limited to, the right to reproduce,
    modify, display, perform and distribute the Contribution; provided
    that this license is conditioned upon compliance with Section 2.3.

(c) To the extent that any of the rights in Section 2.1(a) can neither
    be assigned nor licensed by You to Us, You irrevocably waive and
    agree never to assert such rights against Us, any of our
    successors in interest, or any of our licensees, either direct or
    indirect; provided that this agreement not to assert is
    conditioned upon compliance with Section 2.3.

(d) Upon such transfer of rights to Us, to the maximum extent
    possible, We immediately grant to You a perpetual, worldwide,
    non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, irrevocable license
    under such rights covering the Contribution, with rights to
    sublicense through multiple tiers of sublicensees, to reproduce,
    modify, display, perform, and distribute the Contribution. The
    intention of the parties is that this license will be as broad as
    possible and to provide You with rights as similar as possible to
    the owner of the rights that You transferred. This license back is
    limited to the Contribution and does not provide any rights to the
    Material.

2.2 Patent License
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For patent claims including, without limitation, method, process, and
apparatus claims which You own, control or have the right to grant,
now or in the future, You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license,
with the right to sublicense these rights to multiple tiers of
sublicensees, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import
and otherwise transfer the Contribution and the Contribution in
combination with the Material (and portions of such combination). This
license is granted only to the extent that the exercise of the
licensed rights infringes such patent claims; and provided that this
license is conditioned upon compliance with Section 2.3.

2.3 Outbound License
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Based on the grant of rights in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, if We include
Your Contribution in a Material, We may license the Contribution under
any license, including copyleft, permissive, commercial, or
proprietary licenses. As a condition on the exercise of this right, We
agree to also license the Contribution under the terms of the license
or licenses which We are using for the Material on the Submission
Date.

2.4 Moral Rights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If moral rights apply to the Contribution, to the maximum extent
permitted by law, You waive and agree not to assert such moral rights
against Us or our successors in interest, or any of our licensees,
either direct or indirect.

2.5 Our Rights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You acknowledge that We are not obligated to use Your Contribution as
part of the Material and may decide to include any Contribution We
consider appropriate.

2.6 Reservation of Rights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any rights not expressly assigned or licensed under this section are
expressly reserved by You.

3. Agreement
------------

You confirm that:

(a) You have the legal authority to enter into this Agreement.

(b) You own the Copyright and patent claims covering the Contribution
    which are required to grant the rights under Section 2.

(c) The grant of rights under Section 2 does not violate any grant of
    rights which You have made to third parties, including Your
    employer. If You are an employee, You have had Your employer
    approve this Agreement or sign the Entity version of this
    document. If You are less than eighteen years old, please have
    Your parents or guardian sign the Agreement.

(d) You have informed us in the relevant pull request(s) if You do not
    own the Copyright to the entire Submission.

4. Disclaimer
-------------

EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES IN SECTION 3, THE CONTRIBUTION IS
PROVIDED "AS IS". MORE PARTICULARLY, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT
ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY YOU TO US AND BY US TO YOU. TO THE EXTENT
THAT ANY SUCH WARRANTIES CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED, SUCH WARRANTY IS
LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE MINIMUM PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW.

5. Consequential Damage Waiver
------------------------------

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
YOU OR US BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF ANTICIPATED
SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL
AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF THE
LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE
CLAIM IS BASED.

6. Miscellaneous
----------------

**6.1** This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of Ontario, Canada excluding its conflicts of law
provisions. Under certain circumstances, the governing law in this
section might be superseded by the United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods ("UN Convention") and
the parties intend to avoid the application of the UN Convention to
this Agreement and, thus, exclude the application of the UN Convention
in its entirety to this Agreement.

**6.2** This Agreement sets out the entire agreement between You and
Us for Your Contributions to Us and overrides all other agreements or
understandings.

**6.3** If You or We assign the rights or obligations received through
this Agreement to a third party, as a condition of the assignment,
that third party must agree in writing to abide by all the rights and
obligations in the Agreement.

**6.4** The failure of either party to require performance by the
other party of any provision of this Agreement in one situation shall
not affect the right of a party to require such performance at any
time in the future. A waiver of performance under a provision in one
situation shall not be considered a waiver of the performance of the
provision in the future or a waiver of the provision in its entirety.

**6.5** If any provision of this Agreement is found void and
unenforceable, such provision will be replaced to the extent possible
with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original
provision and which is enforceable. The terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential
purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy to the maximum extent
possible under law.
