# nbv

Read-only Jupyter Notebook viewing using `nbconvert`.

Invoking
```
nbv notebook.ipynb
```
converts the notebook to HTML[^1] and opens this HTML file in the default web browser.

You can get a similar result with just
```
nbconvert notebook.ipynb --to html --post serve
```
Note that this (and `nbv`) doesn't require a full Jupyter installation (e.g. JupyterLab) in order to run.
But `nbv` has additional benefits[^2]:
* doesn't pollute the notebook location with HTML (unlike the above)
* no server, just open the HTML file in browser
* simple CLI, exposing only a few `nbconvert` options

**Note:** `nbv` will use the [`nbconvert` library](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/stable/nbconvert_library.html) if installed, otherwise it will fall back to the `jupyter-nbconvert` [command](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html).

### [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) examples

Use `jupyter-nbconvert` command:
```
uvx nbv notebook.ipynb
```

Use `nbconvert` library:
```
uvx --with nbconvert nbv notebook.ipynb
```
```
uvx --from 'nbv[complete]' nbv notebook.ipynb
```
```
uv tool install --with nbconvert nbv
```
