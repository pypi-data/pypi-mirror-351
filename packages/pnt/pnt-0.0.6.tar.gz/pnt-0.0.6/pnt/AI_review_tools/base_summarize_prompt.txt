You are assisting with an academic literature review on the topic: "{topic}".

Your task is to synthesize the key themes and findings across these abstracts into {num_summary_points} summary points.

Each summary point should be 3-4 sentences.

For each summary point, identify the articles that support the summary separated by a semicolon (e.g., "1; 3; 4").

Do NOT summarize each abstract individually.

ONLY return a list of summary points using this format:
[{{"summary point": "...", "supporting articles": "..."}}]
