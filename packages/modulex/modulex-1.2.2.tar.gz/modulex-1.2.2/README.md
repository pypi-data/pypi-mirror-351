## üìñ Quick Start

### Interactive Main Panel (Recommended for Testing)

If you want to test the module or prefer an easier directory management experience, use the interactive main panel:

```python
import modulex

# Launch the interactive file manager
modulex.mainpanel()
```

This opens a user-friendly menu where you can:

-   Choose operations through numbered options (1-5)
-   Navigate through all available functions
-   Perfect for testing and general file management

### Advanced Individual Function Usage

For more advanced editing or when integrating into your own scripts, you can call individual functions directly:

```python
import modulex

# Create a new folder
modulex.createfolder()

# Create a new text file
modulex.createFile()

# Delete a folder
modulex.deletefolder()

# Delete a file
modulex.deleteFile()
```

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Using the Main Panel

```python
import modulex

modulex.mainpanel()
# Opens interactive menu:
# === ModuleX File Manager ===
# 1. Create Folder
# 2. Delete Folder
# 3. Create File
# 4. Delete File
# 5. Exit
```

### Individual Function Examples

### Creating a Folder

```python
import modulex

modulex.createfolder()
# Prompts: "Enter a name for a new folder: "
# Input: "my project folder"
# Creates: "my_project_folder" directory
```

### Creating a Text File

```python
import modulex

modulex.createFile()
# Prompts for filename (max 20 characters)
# Currently supports .txt files only
# Allows you to add content to the file
```
