# Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA)

Simulated Annealing (SA) has been initially proposed in 
[*Optimization by Simulated Annealing*](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.220.4598.671) as 
an optimization heuristic. Multi-objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) extends the original, 
single-objective SA to approximate the Pareto front in multi-objective optimization problems. 

A comprehensive discussion on MOSA and its algorithm variants can be found in 
[*Multi-objective Simulated Annealing: Principles and Algorithm Variants*](https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/8134674).
