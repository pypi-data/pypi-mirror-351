# W4 Benchmark

An algorithm benchmarking tool built around the W4-11 dataset of high-accuracy thermochemical data.  
Designed for evaluating the performance of computational chemistry methods.

## Features

- Decorator-based workflow with CLI execution
- Programmatic entrypoint for manual workflows
- Built-in support for iterating over all molecules in the W4-11 dataset

## Installation

Install the package via pip:

    pip install w4benchmark

Requires: `numpy >= 2.2.4`

## Usage

This package provides two main decorators:

- `@W4Decorators.process(...)`: For processing each molecule (e.g., computing energies)
- `@W4Decorators.analyze(...)`: For analyzing the results (e.g., comparing predictions to reference data)

Each decorated function **must accept exactly two parameters**: the molecule name (`str`) and a `Molecule` object.

Both decorators support passing an arbitrary list of runtime parameters to customize the execution over the entire dataset.

### Example: Script with Decorators

Create a script like `compute.py`:

    from w4benchmark import W4Decorators, Molecule, W4

    @W4Decorators.process()
    def compute_energy(name: str, mol: Molecule):
        # Replace with real computation

    @W4Decorators.analyze()
    def analyze_results(name: str, mol: Molecule):
        # Replace with real analytics

Then run from the command line with either:

    python compute.py --process

or:

    python compute.py --analyze

Each command will iterate over every molecule in the dataset and apply the corresponding decorated function.

### Manual Execution

If you want full control, you can manually run the W4 benchmark from within a `__main__` block:

    from w4benchmark import W4

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        W4.parameters.basis = "sto6g"  # Set runtime parameters
        W4.init()

        # Example usage
        for name, mol in W4:
            print(f"{name}: spin = {mol.spin}, charge = {mol.charge}")

## SQD Minimal Working Example

The MWE illustrates the essential components of the SQD algorithm:

- **Basic random quantum circuit**: A small quantum circuit is generated with random single-qubit rotations and entangling gates.
- **Measurement simulation**: The wavefunction is sampled ideally (without noise) to generate measurement bitstrings.
- **Electron configuration conversion**: Measurements are filtered into electron configurations.
- **SQD execution**: A toy 4-qubit Hamiltonian is used with the SQD method to approximate the ground-state energy.
- **Simplified output**: Key results like sampled configurations and computed energies are printed.

This provides a lightweight, self-contained example of how SQD can be implemented, separate from the full W4-11 benchmark infrastructure.

## Features

- **No dataset dependencies**: The MWE uses a manually defined Hamiltonian rather than reading from benchmark datasets.
- **Simple circuit creation**: Random gates are applied to generate a demonstrative quantum circuit.
- **Ideal measurement sampling**: Bitstrings are sampled from the exact wavefunction, not from noisy hardware simulations.
- **Subspace filtering**: Bitstrings are filtered based on electron count constraints to form a subspace.
- **Projected Hamiltonian diagonalization**: An approximate ground-state energy is computed from the subspace.
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only `numpy`, `qiskit`, and standard Python libraries are required.
