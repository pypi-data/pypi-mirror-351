## Follow the RULES!!!
- Follow the guidelines in `CLAUDE.md` for managing a task list for dealing with this task list.

## Relevant Files

- `pyproject.toml` - Package configuration with entry points that need CLI script additions. ✅ UPDATED: Added generate-code-review and review-with-ai entry points
- `src/generate_code_review_context.py` - Main context generation tool needing direct CLI entry point. ✅ UPDATED: Changed default model from gemini-2.5-flash to gemini-2.0-flash, updated grounding support
- `src/ai_code_review.py` - AI review tool needing direct CLI entry point and main() function verification. ✅ UPDATED: Fixed import paths, verified main() function works
- `src/__init__.py` - ✅ CREATED: Added package initialization file for proper module structure
- `src/server.py` - MCP server that must remain unchanged to preserve functionality.
- `README.md` - Documentation with broken examples that need updates with working commands. ✅ UPDATED: Fixed model configuration examples to use gemini-2.0-flash as default
- `tests/test_cli_enhancements.py` - CLI parameter tests that need validation updates.
- `tests/test_uvx_integration.py` - New test file for uvx execution and environment variable testing.
- `tests/test_pypi_installation.py` - New test file for PyPI installation validation.

### Notes

- Focus on minimal changes to reduce risk while fixing core CLI execution issues
- Environment variable handling needs investigation and testing across uvx versions
- All documented examples must work exactly as written after PyPI publication
- MCP server functionality must remain 100% unchanged
- Use `uvx --from build pyproject-build` for building packages locally
