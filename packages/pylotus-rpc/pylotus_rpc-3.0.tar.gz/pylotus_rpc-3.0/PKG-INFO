          (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
              distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
              include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
              within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
              pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
              of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
              as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
              documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
              within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
              wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
              of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
              do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
              notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
              or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
              that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
              as modifying the License.
        
          You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
          may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
          for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
          for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
          reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
          the conditions stated in this License.
        
        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
          any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
          by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
          this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
          agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
          Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
          WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
          implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
          of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
          PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
          appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
          risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
          whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
          unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
          negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
          liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
          incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
          result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
          Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
          work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
          other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
          the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
          and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
          or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
          License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
          on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
          of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
          defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
          incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
          of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
        APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
          To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
          boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
          replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
          the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
          comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
          file or class name and description of purpose be included on the

# PyLotus-RPC

PyLotus-RPC is a Python client library for interacting with the Lotus JSON-RPC API. It provides a convenient way to communicate with Filecoin nodes from your Python applications.

This codebase is still a WIP. All Filecoin.StateXXXX, Filecoin.ChainXXX, and Filecoin.NetXXX calls have been implemented. Other methods are being added over time.

<a href="https://filecoin.drips.network/app/projects/github/FilForge/pylotus-rpc" target="_blank"><img src="https://filecoin.drips.network/api/embed/project/https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FFilForge%2Fpylotus-rpc/support.png?background=light&style=github&text=project&stat=none" alt="Support pylotus-rpc on drips.network" height="20"></a>

## Installation

```shell
pip install pylotus-rpc
```

## Quick Start

The `LotusClient` provides access to Filecoin blockchain data through Chain, State, and Net APIs. All methods require an `HttpJsonRpcConnector` for communication with Lotus nodes.

### Basic Setup

```python
from pylotus_rpc import LotusClient, HttpJsonRpcConnector

# Connect to a public Filecoin node
connector = HttpJsonRpcConnector(host='https://api.node.glif.io/rpc/v0')
client = LotusClient(connector)

# Or connect to your local Lotus node with authentication
connector = HttpJsonRpcConnector(
    host='http://localhost:1234/rpc/v0',
    api_token='your_lotus_api_token'
)
client = LotusClient(connector)
```

## Chain Methods

Access blockchain data including blocks, tipsets, and messages.

```python
# Get the current chain head
chain_head = client.Chain.head()
print(f"Current height: {chain_head.height}")

# Get a specific block by CID
block_cid = "bafy2bzacedkoa5xstphncs3da4d6kpbdvbxlg5zkfgxsxhpbcsfmzfhtm7v3y"
block = client.Chain.get_block(cid=block_cid)

# Get messages in a block
block_messages = client.Chain.get_block_messages(block_cid=block_cid)

# Get a tipset by keys
tipset_key = [{'/': block_cid}]
tipset = client.Chain.get_tip_set(tipset_key=tipset_key)

# Read raw object data
object_data = client.Chain.read_obj(cid=block_cid)
```

## State Methods

Query Filecoin network state including miner information, deals, and verifiers.

```python
# Get miner power and information
miner_address = "f01000"
miner_power = client.State.miner_power(address=miner_address)
miner_info = client.State.miner_info(address=miner_address)

# Get active sectors for a miner
active_sectors = client.State.miner_active_sectors(address=miner_address)

# Wait for message confirmation
message_cid = "bafy2bzacedq..."
message_lookup = client.State.wait_msg_limited(
    cid=message_cid, 
    confidence=3, 
    limit=100
)

# Check verifier status
verifier_address = "f1..."
verifier_status = client.State.verifier_status(address=verifier_address)

# Get network version and genesis info
network_version = client.State.network_version()
genesis = client.Chain.get_genesis()
```

## Network Methods

Monitor and manage network connections, bandwidth, and peer information.

```python
# Get network statistics
stats = client.Net.stat(scope="system")
print(f"Total bandwidth in: {stats['TotalIn']}")

# Get address information
addr_info = client.Net.addrs_listen()
print(f"Listening addresses: {addr_info}")

# Check NAT status
nat_info = client.Net.auto_nat_status()

# Set network limits (requires write permissions)
limits = {
    "Memory": 1024 * 1024 * 1024,  # 1GB
    "Streams": 100
}
success = client.Net.set_limit("libp2p", limits)
```

## Error Handling

Handle API errors using the specific `ApiCallError` exception:

```python
from pylotus_rpc.http_json_rpc_connector import HttpJsonRpcConnector

ApiCallError = HttpJsonRpcConnector.ApiCallError

try:
    block_info = client.Chain.get_block(cid="invalid_cid")
except ApiCallError as e:
    print(f"API call failed: {e.method} - {e.message} (code: {e.code})")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
```

## Filecoin Concepts

- **CID**: Content Identifier, a unique hash identifying blocks, messages, and data
- **Tipset**: A set of blocks at the same height in the blockchain
- **Miner**: Storage provider in the Filecoin network
- **Sector**: Unit of storage committed by miners
- **Message**: Transactions and state changes in Filecoin
