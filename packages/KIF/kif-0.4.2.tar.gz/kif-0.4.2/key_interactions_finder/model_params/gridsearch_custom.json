If you wish to add you're own custom grid search cv parameter set you can do it here.

Then when you make an instance of either the class "ClassificationModel" or "RegressionModel" you can set the "search_approach" parameter to "custom"
and this file will be read in.

See the other .json files in this folder to figure out how to structure your grid search cv parameters.
