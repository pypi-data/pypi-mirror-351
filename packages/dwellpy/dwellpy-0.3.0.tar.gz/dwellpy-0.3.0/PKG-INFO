**An accessibility tool that lets you click by hovering** - designed for people with motor disabilities who use head trackers, eye trackers, or have limited hand mobility.

*Made by a disabled person, for the disabled community.*

---

## üéØ What is Dwellpy?

Instead of physically clicking, **just hover your cursor over any area for a short time** and Dwellpy will click for you automatically. This "dwell clicking" technique is essential for people who:

- Use head tracking or eye tracking devices
- Have cerebral palsy, hand tremors, or limited dexterity  
- Experience fatigue, weakness, or repetitive strain injuries
- Have conditions like Parkinson's, arthritis, or muscular dystrophy
- Use alternative mouse controls where physical clicking isn't possible

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üñ±Ô∏è **Smart Clicking**
- **Multiple Click Types**: Left, right, double-click, and drag operations
- **Intelligent Modes**: Temporary mode switching with visual feedback  
- **Adaptive Sensitivity**: Customizable hover time and movement tolerance

### üìú **Hands-Free Scrolling**
- **Floating Scroll Widget**: Follows your cursor automatically
- **Hover to Scroll**: No clicking required - just hover over arrows
- **Smart Positioning**: Stays out of your way, locks when you need precision

### ‚ôø **Accessibility First**
- **Motor Disability Support**: Designed specifically for movement challenges
- **Customizable Settings**: Adapt to your specific needs and abilities
- **Persistent Configuration**: Set it once, works every time
- **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## üöÄ Quick Start

Get up and running in 2 minutes:

### 1. Install Dwellpy
```bash
pip install dwellpy
```

### 2. Launch the App
```bash
dwellpy
```

### 3. Start Using
- Click the green **ON/OFF** button to activate
- **Windows users**: For best results, run as Administrator (recommended)
- **macOS users**: Grant Accessibility permissions when prompted (required for mouse control)
- Hover your cursor anywhere for 1 second - it will click automatically!
- Use the **SETUP** button to adjust sensitivity to your needs

That's it! üéâ

## üìñ How to Use

### Main Interface

Dwellpy shows a small toolbar with these buttons:

| Button | Function | Visual Cue |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **ON/OFF** | Activate/deactivate dwell clicking | üü¢ Green = On, üî¥ Red = Off |
| **LEFT** | Left click mode (default) | üîµ Blue = Default mode |
| **DOUBLE** | Double-click mode | üî¥ Red = Temporary mode |
| **DRAG** | Drag operation mode | Requires two hovers: down + up |
| **RIGHT** | Right-click mode | For context menus |
| **SCROLL** | Toggle scroll widget | üü¢ Green = Active |
| **SETUP** | Open settings | Customize to your needs |
| **MOVE** | Reposition toolbar | Drag to move |
| **EXIT** | Close application | |

### Click Mode System

**üîµ Default Mode (Blue)**: Your primary click type - returns here after each action  
**üî¥ Temporary Mode (Red)**: One-time use, then returns to default  

- **Single selection**: Makes a mode temporary (red)
- **Double selection**: Makes a mode permanent default (blue)

### Scroll Widget

The scroll widget automatically appears near your cursor when active:

- **Follows your cursor** at a safe distance
- **Locks in place** when you get close for precision
- **Hover over arrows** to scroll up ‚¨ÜÔ∏è or down ‚¨áÔ∏è  
- **Quick toggle** with SCROLL button (great for avoiding conflicts with on-screen keyboards)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings & Configuration

Access via **SETUP** button - all settings apply immediately:

### Core Settings

**Move Limit (3-20px)**: How much your cursor can move while "dwelling"
- Head tracker users: 8-15px (natural head movement)
- Hand tremors/cerebral palsy: 10-20px (accommodates movement)
- Good stability: 3-8px (precise control)

**Dwell Time (0.1-2.0s)**: How long to hover before clicking
- Fatigue/concentration issues: 0.1-0.5s (less sustained focus)
- Prevent accidents: 0.8-2.0s (deliberate clicking)
- Head tracker users: 0.5-0.8s (balanced)

### Advanced Settings

**Window Transparency**: Make toolbar see-through when not in use  
**Scroll Widget**: Adjust speed, positioning, and opacity  
**Auto-Start**: Launch active by default

### Accessibility-Friendly Controls

Settings can be adjusted by **hovering over +/- buttons** - no clicking required!
