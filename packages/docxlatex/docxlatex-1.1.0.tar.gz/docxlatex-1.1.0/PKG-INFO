# docxlatex
A python library for extracting text and images from .docx files with LaTeX support

Influenced by [python-docx](https://github.com/python-openxml/python-docx) and [python-docx2txt](https://github.com/ankushshah89/python-docx2txt).
This project aims to expand the above libraries' functionality by allowing you to extract the equations in a .docx file and converting them to valid LaTeX.

docxlatex DOES NOT convert the entire .docx file to a LaTeX source file.

# Installation
Install using pip  
`pip install docxlatex`

# Usage

Import the `Document` class from `docxlatex`

```python
from docxlatex import Document
```

Create a `Document` object, giving it the path to the .docx file, and call the `get_text()` method
```python
doc = Document("path/to/document")
text = doc.get_text()
```

You can also set some settings on the `Document` object to customize behaviour, like setting the delimiters that will go before and after an equation, 
and flags to extract header and footer text. Read the documentation at [hrushikeshrv.github.io/docxlatex](https://hrushikeshrv.github.io/docxlatex) for all options.

```python
doc.inline_delimiter = "%" # "$" by default
doc.block_delimiter = "%%" # "$$" by default
```
