class _FieldBase(FieldCoreMixin):
    """
    Abstract base class for geometric data fields on structured grids.

    :class:`FieldBase` serves as the foundational interface for all field representations in the
    Pymetric library, enabling storage and manipulation of scalar, vector, or tensor-valued
    data defined over structured grids in curvilinear coordinate systems.

    This class is not intended to be used directly. Instead, concrete subclasses such as
    :class:`DenseField` and :class:`SparseField` implement specific data layouts and behavior. The base
    class provides core infrastructure for:

    - Attaching a field to a geometric `GridBase` object.
    - Managing a dictionary of `FieldComponent` objects.
    - Supporting both dense (single-component) and sparse (multi-component) layouts.
    - Validating component compatibility with the grid and coordinate system.
    - Providing consistent introspection through `grid`, `components`, and `coordinate_system`.

    Fields store values over structured domains, and each component can include additional
    trailing element-wise dimensions to represent vector or tensor values. All components
    must share the same underlying grid and be accessed via a canonicalized dictionary of
    component indices (typically integers or tuples of integers).

    Notes
    -----
    Subclasses must implement field-specific logic such as numerical operations, indexing,
    and transformations. This class assumes that all components are already validated and normalized.

    The base class (``_FieldBase``) lacks most relevant structures because they are implemented differently
    in each of the relevant subclasses. As such, the class lacks basic arithmetic support and a variety of
    other useful methods.

    Field class for sparse, multi-component representations on structured grids.

    `SparseField` represents a field composed of multiple independent `FieldComponent` objects,
    each identified by a unique index (typically an integer or a tuple of integers). This class
    is designed to support fields with:

    - Explicitly indexed tensor components (e.g., Táµ¢â±¼)
    - Direction-dependent or variably-defined field data
    - Sparse physical quantities (e.g., only select components are populated)

    Unlike `DenseField`, which wraps a single component and assumes uniform structure,
    `SparseField` allows for heterogeneous or partially defined field data across multiple
    indexed subfields.
