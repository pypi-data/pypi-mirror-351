Core coordinate system classes for user / developer subclassing.

This module (as opposed to :py:mod:`~coordinates.base`) provides stub classes for defining
custom coordinate systems that fall into a few standard types:

1. **Curvilinear Coordinate Systems**: should be descended from :py:class:`CurvilinearCoordinateSystem`.
2. **Orthogonal Coordinate Systems**: should be descended from :py:class:`OrthogonalCoordinateSystem`.

class CurvilinearCoordinateSystem(_CoordinateSystemBase, ABC):
    """
    Base class for general curvilinear coordinate systems.

    This class provides the foundational interface for coordinate systems in which the axes may be
    curved or non-uniform but are not necessarily orthogonal. Unlike `OrthogonalCoordinateSystem`,
    the metric tensor for a `CurvilinearCoordinateSystem` may contain off-diagonal components,
    allowing it to support a broader range of geometries including skewed, stretched, or sheared
    coordinate systems.

    Subclasses must define the coordinate axes and parameters using the ``__AXES__`` and ``__PARAMETERS__``
    class attributes, and must implement the ``__construct_metric_tensor_symbol__`` method to return
    the full symbolic metric tensor (including both diagonal and off-diagonal elements).

    Symbolic processing is triggered either lazily upon instantiation or eagerly at import time,
    depending on the ``__setup_point__`` attribute. Most systems should default to lazy initialization
    (``"init"``) for improved performance and reduced import time.

    Features
    --------
    - Symbolic representation and evaluation of the full (non-diagonal) metric tensor
    - Placeholder for extension to general differential geometry operations (gradient, divergence, etc.)
    - Support for user-defined coordinate systems with custom metric behavior
    - Encodes system axes, parameters, and symbolic processing hooks for downstream utilities

    Notes
    -----
    This class provides minimal functionality on its own, as it is intended to be subclassed
    by users creating general curvilinear systems. Users must implement custom logic for
    differential geometry operations unless handled externally.

class OrthogonalCoordinateSystem(_CoordinateSystemBase, ABC):
    r"""
    Base class for orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems.

    This class provides the foundational symbolic and numerical machinery for defining and working
    with orthogonal coordinate systemsâ€”those in which the metric tensor is diagonal and basis vectors
    are mutually perpendicular. It supports automatic symbolic generation of differential geometry
    operators such as the gradient, divergence, and Laplacian, as well as index manipulation utilities
    for raising and lowering tensor components.

    Subclasses should define the coordinate axes and parameter set via the ``__AXES__`` and ``__PARAMETERS__``
    class attributes, and must implement the ``__construct_metric_tensor_symbol__`` method to specify
    the diagonal components of the metric tensor symbolically.

    Coordinate systems may be initialized lazily (at instance creation) or eagerly (at import time) depending
    on the ``__setup_point__`` class attribute. Most systems should use lazy setup for performance.

    Features
    --------
    - Symbolic and numeric computation of metric, inverse metric, and metric density
    - Raising and lowering of tensor indices using orthogonal metric contractions
    - Computation of gradient, divergence, and Laplacian in both covariant and contravariant bases
    - Automatic handling of coordinate slices via `fixed_axes`
    - Support for symbolic dependence analysis for field operations


    Notes
    -----
    This class assumes that the metric tensor is diagonal, as is true for all orthogonal systems.
    Mixed metric components (i.e., :math:`g_{ij}` for :math:`i \\ne j`) are assumed to be zero.
