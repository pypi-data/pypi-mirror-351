Fields: Overview
====================

In Pymetric, **fields** (:mod:`fields`) are the most important data structure for representing
numerical quantities defined over geometric grids. They provide a uniform interface
for scalar, vector, and tensor-valued data in arbitrary coordinate systems.

Operationally, fields behave similarly to `NumPy <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html>`__ arrays. They support arithmetic,
slicing, unit-aware computation (via `unyt <https://unyt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__), and broadcasting—
but with full awareness of the spatial domain and coordinate system they inhabit.

This document provides an introductory look at these objects and some of the things you can do with them!

What is a Field?
----------------

Fields are high-level objects in PyMetric which hold structured data on a specific
geometric grid (see :mod:`grids` and :ref:`grids`), which in turn contains an underlying
coordinate system (see :mod:`coordinates` and :ref:`coordinates_user`). They abstract away the complexity
of differential geometry and provide:

- Grid-aligned storage and shape metadata
- Physical units (if present) and element-wise structure (e.g., tensors)
- Support for arithmetic, reduction, reshaping, and numerical operations
- Integration with symbolic and numerical differential operators

Each field consists of one or more **components** (:class:`~fields.components.FieldComponent`), and each component stores
its data in a **buffer** (:class:`~fields.buffers.base.BufferBase`). The field manages how those components are laid out
and ensures consistency with the grid.

Sparse Fields vs. Dense Fields
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Pymetric currently supports **two** major field representations:

- **Dense Fields** (:class:`~fields.base.DenseField` and descendants):

  Are composed of a **single component** of a specific shape. For example,
  in spherical coordinate system (3D), a vector field would be densely represented with a single
  component of shape ``(..., 3)``.

  For tensor fields specifically, **dense representations** are required to have **all** of the
  necessary indices, even if they are zero. Thus, dense fields are often simpler to work with and
  have more efficient numerical operations; however, in cases where only some components are relevant,
  a large memory and computation overhead is incurred to handle data that isn't necessary.

- **Sparse Fields** (:class:`~fields.base.SparseField` and descendants)(planned):

  Are composed of **multiple components** all of which are **scalar components**
  on the grid. Thus, for a vector field in spherical coordinates, there would be 3 separate components
  in a sparse representation, one for each direction.

  For tensor fields, the great advantage of **sparse representation** is that missing components
  can be treated as implicitly zero. Thus, a vector field with only a :math:`\hat{\bf r}` component
  would only need one scalar component.

.. important::

    Support for sparse operations is planned but not yet implemented.

Buffers and Components
'''''''''''''''''''''''

Each field consists of one or more **components** (:class:`~fields.components.FieldComponent`), and each component stores
its data in a **buffer** (:class:`~fields.buffers.base.BufferBase`). Here's how they relate:

- **Buffers** are the raw data containers. They abstract over memory/storage
  backends (e.g., NumPy arrays, `unyt` arrays with units, or HDF5-backed arrays).
  Buffers provide arithmetic, indexing, and I/O functionality.
- **FieldComponents** wrap a buffer and associate it with a subset of the grid axes
  and an element shape. This allows them to represent scalar values, vectors, or tensors.
- **Fields** manage one or more components and provide the full user interface.

This design separates memory layout (buffers), spatial semantics (components),
and user interaction (fields), enabling modularity and extensibility.

For the most part, users won't have need to interact with buffers at all and with components only rarely. They
are largely just logical separators for code maintainability. Nonetheless, some operations do expose lower level
backends and it is useful to understand the classes involved when such instances arise.

Special Types of Fields
'''''''''''''''''''''''

There are two "parent field classes": :class:`~fields.base.SparseField` and :class:`~fields.base.DenseField`. In turn,
various special field types descent from these two archetypes. The most important of these are **tensor fields**,
which provide marginally more structure to their base classes while allowing for fully covariant computations like
divergences, curls, etc. These are stored in the :mod:`fields.tensors` module.

For most scientific workflows, users should use the :class:`~fields.tensors.DenseTensorField` class which provides
all of the relevant structure for things like vectors, co-vectors, scalar fields, etc.

Creating Fields
---------------

There are a number of ways to create fields in PyMetric, largely depending on what information the user wishes
to provide in creating the instance. In this section, we'll walk through some of the various options that are most
common.

Building a Field from Components
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Perhaps the most direct way to construct a field is to first create one or more instances of
:class:`~fields.components.FieldComponent`. This is especially true when using the default
constructor—i.e., calling ``DenseField(...)``—which expects the data to already be wrapped
in a fully-formed :class:`~fields.components.FieldComponent`. The constructor does not accept raw arrays,
functions, or other input types directly. For those use cases, convenience constructors should be used instead (see below).

.. tab-set::
    :sync-group: ftype

    .. tab-item:: Dense Field
        :sync: Dense

        To construct a dense field (:class:`~fields.base.DenseField`) directly, the user must provide
        a grid (see :mod:`grids`) and a **single** component:

        .. code-block:: python

            from pymetric import DenseField, CartesianCoordinateSystem2D, GenericGrid, FieldComponent

            cs = CartesianCoordinateSystem2D()
            x, y = [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]
            g = GenericGrid(cs, [x, y])
            component = FieldComponent.zeros(g,['x','y'])
            f = DenseField(g,component)

    .. tab-item:: Dense Tensor Field
        :sync: DenseTensor

        To construct a dense tensor field (:class:`~fields.tensors.DenseTensorField`) directly, the user must provide
        a grid (see :mod:`grids`), a **single** component, **and** (optionally) the signature of the tensor. For example,
        a scalar field can be created with

        .. code-block:: python

            from pymetric import DenseField, CartesianCoordinateSystem2D, GenericGrid, FieldComponent

            cs = CartesianCoordinateSystem2D()
            x, y = [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]
            g = GenericGrid(cs, [x, y])
            component = FieldComponent.zeros(g,['x','y'])
            f = DenseField(g,component)

        .. warning::

            A valid tensor field component must have an element shape like ``(Ndim, Ndim, ...)`` or
            an error is raised. This is reflective of the dense representation convention where all indices
            are required.

        A vector field looks like

        .. code-block:: python

            from pymetric import DenseField, CartesianCoordinateSystem2D, GenericGrid, FieldComponent

            cs = CartesianCoordinateSystem2D()
            x, y = [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]
            g = GenericGrid(cs, [x, y])
            component = FieldComponent.zeros(g,['x','y'],element_shape=(2,))
            f = DenseField(g,component)

        To create a **covector** field, ``signature`` should be specified:

        .. code-block:: python

            from pymetric import DenseField, CartesianCoordinateSystem2D, GenericGrid, FieldComponent

            cs = CartesianCoordinateSystem2D()
            x, y = [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]
            g = GenericGrid(cs, [x, y])
            component = FieldComponent.zeros(g,['x','y'],element_shape=(2,))
            f = DenseField(g,component,signature=(-1,))

    .. tab-item:: Sparse Field
        :sync: Sparse

        .. important::

            Not yet implemented.


Building a Generic Field
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

Like most array-manipulation libraries, PyMetric provides a number of field entry points for building
empty fields as well as fields filled with either ``0`` or ``1``. These mirror the standard behavior of functions
like :func:`numpy.zeros`, :func:`numpy.ones`, etc.

Many classes in PyMetric implement these as methods (i.e. :class:`~fields.buffers.base.BufferBase`, :class:`~grids.base.GridBase`,
and :class:`~fields.components.FieldComponent`), including **all of the field classes**. The call signatures vary somewhat
between methods to account for differences in structure:

.. tab-set::
    :sync-group: ftype

    .. tab-item:: Dense Field
        :sync: Dense

        For dense fields, the operations works just like one would expect.

        .. code-block:: python

            from pymetric import DenseField, CartesianCoordinateSystem2D, GenericGrid, FieldComponent

            cs = CartesianCoordinateSystem2D()
            x, y = [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]
            g = GenericGrid(cs, [x, y])
            component = FieldComponent.zeros(g,['x','y'])
            f = DenseField.zeros(g, ['x']) # Create scalar field over x axis of g.

        A number of options are available to determine how the underlying buffer behaves, what
        shape the field has, etc. For details, look at :meth:`~fields.base.DenseField.zeros`.

    .. tab-item:: Dense Tensor Field
        :sync: DenseTensor

        For tensor fields, the operations works a little bit different than for :class:`~fields.base.DenseField`.
        Instead of controlling the shape of the field with the ``element_shape=`` kwarg, :meth:`~fields.tensors.DenseTensorField.zeros`
        takes 1 additional positional argument: ``rank`` (the rank of the tensor) and uses that to determine the
        correct (dense) shape. Additionally, ``signature=`` may be used to specify the variance.

        .. code-block:: python

            from pymetric import DenseTensorField, CartesianCoordinateSystem2D, GenericGrid, FieldComponent

            cs = CartesianCoordinateSystem2D()
            x, y = [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]
            g = GenericGrid(cs, [x, y])
            component = FieldComponent.zeros(g,['x','y'])
            f = DenseTensorField.zeros(g, ['x'], 2) # Create rank 2 field over x axis of g.

            # For a covector, you might need:
            f = DenseTensorField.zeros(g, ['x'], 1, signature=(-1,))

        A number of options are available to determine how the underlying buffer behaves, what
        shape the field has, etc. For details, look at :meth:`~fields.tensors.DenseTensorField.zeros`.

    .. tab-item:: Sparse Field
        :sync: Sparse

        .. important::

            Not yet implemented.

In addition to the standard :meth:`~fields.base.DenseField.ones`, :meth:`~fields.base.DenseField.zeros`, and
:meth:`~fields.base.DenseField.full`, all **dense** field representations also implement a :meth:`~fields.base.DenseField.from_array`
method to allow users to provide a generic buffer as the basis for a new field.

Advanced Construction Methods
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In addition to the core construction methods presented above, a few additional methods are available to construct fields
from more esoteric origins. The most significant of these is the :meth:`~fields.base.DenseField.from_function` which allows
users to create fields by specifying directly a function :math:`f(x^1,x^2,\ldots,x^n)`. The following example illustrates
the basic usage:

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import numpy as np
    from pymetric import DenseField, CartesianCoordinateSystem2D, GenericGrid
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Create the coordinate system and the grid.
    cs = CartesianCoordinateSystem2D()
    x, y = (np.linspace(0,1,100),
            np.linspace(0,1,100))
    g = GenericGrid(cs, [x, y])

    # Define a function of the coords.
    func = lambda _x,_y: np.sin(10*np.sqrt(_x**2+_y**2))

    # Create the dense field from the function.
    f = DenseField.from_function(func, g, ['x','y'])

    fig,axes = plt.subplots(1,1)
    Q = axes.imshow(f[...].T,extent=(0,1,0,1))
    axes.set_xlabel('x')
    axes.set_ylabel('y')
    plt.colorbar(Q,ax=axes)
    plt.show()

Field Properties and Data Access
---------------------------------

Once fields are created, they offer a rich interface for interacting with both their
geometric context and numerical data. This section explains the core capabilities
fields provide for data access, metadata retrieval, and computational manipulation.

Properties of Fields
''''''''''''''''''''

Fields are built on top of structured grids and are deeply
aware of their spatial and element-wise structure. Every field, whether
sparse or dense, encodes both where data lives (i.e., the grid and its axes)
and what kind of data it holds (e.g., scalars, vectors, tensors).

- Linkage to grid, axes (dense), and coordinate system.
- element_shape, spatial_shape,element_ndim, spatial_ndim, etc.
- Point readers to the API documentation for more details.

Some key properties include:

- :attr:`~fields.base.DenseField.grid`: The underlying :class:`~grids.base.GridBase` instance that
  the field lives on. This contains coordinate information, dimensions, and domain metadata.
- :attr:`~fields.base.DenseField.axes`: A list of the axes over which the field spans.
- :attr:`~fields.base.DenseField.spatial_shape`: The shape of the field over its spatial axes.
- :attr:`~fields.base.DenseField.element_shape`: The trailing shape of the data, representing its tensor structure .
- :attr:`~fields.base.DenseField.units`: If unit-aware buffers (e.g., via unyt) are used, this indicates the physical units attached to the field.

Accessing Field Data
''''''''''''''''''''

A major difference between sparse and dense field representations is the syntax for data access. The tabs
below summarize how data access behaves in each case:

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Dense Fields

        Dense fields behave very much like regular NumPy arrays. Indexing directly into a field returns the corresponding
        data slice from the single component buffer. This means you can treat dense fields as array-like objects
        for most numerical and visualization operations:

        .. code-block:: python

            val = field[i, j]           # Scalar or element value at grid index (i, j)
            slice = field[::2, ::2]     # Subsampled field
            comp = field[..., 1]        # Slice of a vector/tensor component

        All operations are performed on the raw buffer data (NumPy, unyt, or HDF5), and indexing reflects that behavior.
        If the field has a unit-aware backend (e.g., `unyt_array`), the result will preserve units.

        You can explicitly retrieve representations using:

        - :meth:`~fields.components.FieldComponent.as_array`: returns a NumPy array (units stripped).
        - :meth:`~fields.components.FieldComponent.as_unyt_array`: returns a `unyt_array` with units.
        - :meth:`~fields.components.FieldComponent.as_buffer_core`: returns the native backend array (e.g., `h5py.Dataset`).
        - :meth:`~fields.components.FieldComponent.as_buffer_repr`: returns a NumPy-compatible representation for ufuncs.

        These methods are particularly useful when exporting to disk, performing raw NumPy operations, or applying custom logic
        where backend control is needed.

    .. tab-item:: Sparse Fields

        Sparse fields (planned) contain multiple components, each aligned with a subset of axes and representing a scalar value.
        Accessing the field returns an individual :class:`~fields.components.FieldComponent`, which must then be indexed:

        .. code-block:: python

            component = field[0]        # Return the first component
            value = component[i, j]       # Access value at spatial index

        Sparse fields are useful when only a few components of a tensor are needed or when symbolic sparsity is important
        (e.g., fields with known zeros). While dense fields always store *all* components (even if zero), sparse fields
        can reduce memory and computation by omitting unnecessary entries.

        **Note**: Because sparse field support is not yet implemented, the behavior outlined above is aspirational and may change.

.. hint::

    When accessing fields in user constructed pipelines, it is often useful to be conscious of how
    access patterns impact memory usage; particularly for buffers which have lazy-loading behaviors.

Broadcasting and Iteration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Talk about the ability to broadcast to arrays and other buffer types in
  new axes and also as general base types.
- Talk about broadcasting to new axes and reducing to new axes.


- In addition, a couple other access patterns:
- Iterating through chunks of the data;
- casting to axes (Dense -> sparse can do the same with each component separately)
- cutting to axes (Dense -> sparse can do the same with each component seperately.)
- Field iterpolation.
