Geometric Grids: General Info
================================

Geometric grids in PyMetric form the spatial backbone for all data fields and computations. A grid is a combination
of a **generic grid structure** and a **coordinate system** (:mod:`coordinates`). This design allows users to precisely map data to physical
space, manage boundary conditions with ghost zones, and leverage efficient chunked operations on large domains.

Overview
--------

The :mod:`grids` module provides the spatial infrastructure for all field-based computations
in PyMetric. Grids define how a physical domain is discretized into a structured layout of
points or cells and enable consistent mappings between coordinate systems,
numerical data, and differential operations.

At its core, a grid consists of two key components:

1. A grid structure (e.g., :class:`~grids.core.UniformGrid`, :class:`~grids.core.GenericGrid`) that
   determines how grid points are arranged and accessed.
2. A coordinate system (see :mod:`coordinates`) that maps grid indices to physical
   space and provides metric-aware geometry for differential operations.

This separation of concerns enables highly flexible and extensible representations of space,
from simple Cartesian domains to complex curvilinear coordinates or non-uniform meshes.
Regardless of grid type, PyMetric provides a unified interface for spatial indexing,
coordinate retrieval, chunked operations, and grid-aware interpolation.

All grid types inherit from the abstract :class:`~grids.base.GridBase`,
which defines the standard API for all grid operations. This ensures that your code can
remain backend-agnostic while still taking full advantage of specialized behaviors from subclasses.

Types of Grids
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PyMetric supports multiple grid classes that implement the same abstract
interface (:class:`~grids.base.GridBase`) but differ in how they discretize
space. The two primary grid types currently available are:

- :class:`~grids.core.GenericGrid` — supports arbitrarily spaced coordinates (non-uniform grids).
- :class:`~grids.core.UniformGrid` — optimized for domains with regularly spaced grid points.

Each is suited to different application needs, and their underlying data
representations reflect trade-offs between flexibility and efficiency.

.. rubric:: :class:`~grids.core.GenericGrid`

The :class:`~grids.core.GenericGrid` is the most flexible grid structure
in PyMetric. It allows you to define each axis by providing a 1D
NumPy array of monotonically increasing coordinates. This makes it well-suited for:

- Grids with **non-uniform resolution**, such as stretched meshes or log-scaled axes.
- Domains with **arbitrary point placement**, such as observational grids or outputs from external simulations.
- Any scenario where grid control or fidelity is more important than performance or simplicity.

Internally, a :class:`~grids.core.GenericGrid` stores the full coordinate arrays for each axis.
This gives the user full control over spatial discretization at the cost of
slightly higher memory and computational overhead.

.. tip::

    If you need to represent complex geometries or use
    different resolutions in different parts of the domain, this is the grid to use.

.. rubric:: :class:`~grids.core.UniformGrid`

The :class:`~grids.core.UniformGrid` is designed for simplicity and performance.
It represents a regular, Cartesian-like mesh defined by:

- A **bounding box** — specifying the physical limits of the domain.
- A **domain shape** — the number of points along each axis.

From these two pieces of information, the grid infers coordinate spacing
and generates points on-the-fly when needed. This design avoids storing
full coordinate arrays, making :class:`~grids.core.UniformGrid`:

- **Very memory efficient**, especially for large domains.
- Ideal for **stencil-based operations**, finite-difference solvers, and image-like data.
- Easy to use when a **rectangular, uniformly spaced** domain is sufficient.

If you do not need adaptive resolution or nonuniform axes, :class:`~grids.core.UniformGrid` is typically the best starting point.

.. note::

    Both grid types integrate seamlessly with the field and buffer systems in PyMetric.
    You can switch between grid types as needed depending on the demands of your problem.


Properties of Fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: ../../images/reference/grid_structure_diagram.png
   :height: 500px
   :align: center

Every grid in PyMetric exposes a consistent set of spatial properties that
describe its structure, extent, and boundary behavior. These properties are
critical for understanding how data maps onto the grid and how operations
like interpolation, differentiation, and boundary handling behave.

The Bounding Box and Domain Dimensions
``````````````````````````````````````

The two most critical properties of any grid are its **domain dimensions** and its
**bounding box**. The **domain dimension** of a grid is the *number of cells along each axis*
of the grid. Each grid class implements this as :attr:`~grids.base.GridBase.dd`.

The **bounding box** determines the physical boundary of the grid and is specified by
the position of the "bottom right" and "top left" corners of the domain. You can
access the bounding box of a grid using :attr:`~grids.base.GridBase.bbox`

.. hint::

    For a uniform grid, the bounding box and the domain dimension uniquely
    determine the size of each cell.

Ghost Regions
`````````````

Ghost regions are auxiliary buffer zones that wrap the physical domain of the grid.
These zones are used to support numerical operations that require access to neighboring cells, such as:

- Finite difference and finite volume stencils.
- Boundary condition enforcement.
- Interpolation and smoothing operations near edges.

In PyMetric, ghost zones are optional and explicitly configurable.
When enabled, they expand the grid with additional cells on both the
lower and upper sides of each axis. This creates a distinction between:

- The **active domain**: the region over which computations and physical data are defined.
- The **global domain**: the active domain plus ghost zones.

Ghost zones are defined via the attribute :attr:`~grids.base.GridBase.ghost_zones`,
which is a ``(2, ndim)`` array indicating how many ghost cells to place on each side of each axis.
The full shape of the grid, including ghosts, is given by :attr:`~grids.base.GridBase.gdd` (ghost domain dimensions).
Likewise, the physical extent including ghosts is described by :attr:`~grids.base.GridBase.gbbox` (ghost bbox).

.. note::

    Ghost zones do not contribute to the grid’s bounding box :attr:`~grids.base.GridBase.bbox`, which remains tied to the physical (active) region.
    The :attr:`~grids.base.GridBase.bbox` is **always a subset** of the :attr:`~grids.base.GridBase.gbbox`.


How ghost zones are implemented depends on the grid type:

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: UniformGrid

        For :class:`~grids.core.UniformGrid`, ghost zones are **injected around** the physical domain.
        These ghost cells are positioned consistently with the internal spacing of the grid, extending
        outward beyond the bounding box. This is ideal for regular Cartesian grids used in PDE solvers
        or image processing.

        - The spacing and coordinate system are used to assign coordinates to ghost points.
        - Ghost cells lie *outside* the physical domain in real space.
        - The global domain expands in all directions accordingly.

        Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            grid = UniformGrid(csys, bbox, shape, ghost_zones=[[2, 2], [2, 2]])
            print(grid.gdd)   # Includes ghost cells
            print(grid.dd)    # Physical domain only
            print(grid.gbbox) # Physical bounding box plus ghost extension

    .. tab-item:: GenericGrid

        For :class:`~grids.core.GenericGrid`, ghost zones are **cut from the user-provided coordinate arrays**.
        In this model, you must supply coordinate arrays that are longer than the intended active domain
        to accommodate the ghost cells explicitly. This is done because a generic grid has no way of "intuiting"
        where to place the ghost cells without explicit instruction.

        - The coordinate arrays must contain values for both physical and ghost regions.
        - No extrapolation or spacing assumptions are made — control remains fully with the user.
        - The outer slices of the array are treated as ghost zones, and the core forms the physical domain.

        Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            # Suppose x has 10 points: 2 ghost on each end, 6 active
            x = np.linspace(-0.2, 1.2, 10)
            grid = GenericGrid(csys, [x], ghost_zones=[[2], [2]])
            print(grid.dd)    # 6
            print(grid.gdd)   # 10

Constructing Grids
------------------

Each subclass of :class:`grids.base.GridBase` has different syntax for creation, reflecting
the different behaviors and required information of different grid types. In general, a grid
requires a **coordinate system** (from :mod:`coordinates`) and then some specification of the grid
positions in that coordinate system.

.. important::

    **ALL** grids span all of the axes of their coordinate system. In the :mod:`fields` module,
    data can exist along only a particular axis slice of the grid, but the grid itself must provide
    discretization for every dimension.

Basic Construction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the tabs below, we'll explain the convention for creating grids for each of the standard
grid types:

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: UniformGrid

        A :class:`~grids.core.UniformGrid` is defined by:

        - A coordinate system instance (e.g., Cartesian, Cylindrical)
        - A bounding box (lower and upper physical edges)
        - The number of grid **points** (cells) along each axis

        The coordinates are computed **on-the-fly**, and the grid requires only the bounding box and resolution.

        .. code-block:: python

            from pymetric.coordinates import CartesianCoordinateSystem2D
            from pymetric.grids import UniformGrid

            csys = CartesianCoordinateSystem2D()
            bbox = [[0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0]]  # [lower_bounds, upper_bounds]
            shape = [100, 100]              # number of cells per axis

            grid = UniformGrid(
                csys,
                bbox,
                shape,
                ghost_zones=[[2, 2], [2, 2]]  # 2 ghost zones on each side
            )

        .. note::

            Ghost zones are **added outside** the physical bounding box for a :class:`UniformGrid`.
            That is, the physical domain remains exactly as specified in `bbox`, and ghost zones expand
            the buffer beyond the domain.

    .. tab-item:: GenericGrid

        A :class:`~grids.core.GenericGrid` is defined by:

        - A coordinate system
        - Explicit coordinate **arrays** (1D arrays per axis)

        These arrays represent either the **cell centers** or **grid vertices**, depending on the `center` argument.
        If `center='vertex'`, no bounding box is needed. If `center='cell'`, the `bbox` must be provided to define the edges.

        .. code-block:: python

            from pymetric.coordinates import CartesianCoordinateSystem2D
            from pymetric.grids import GenericGrid
            import numpy as np

            csys = CartesianCoordinateSystem2D()
            x = np.linspace(0.0, 1.0, 100)
            y = np.linspace(0.0, 2.0, 200)

            grid = GenericGrid(
                csys,
                [x, y],
                center='cell',
                bbox=[[0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0]],
                ghost_zones=[[2, 2], [2, 2]]
            )

        .. note::

            For :class:`~grids.core.GenericGrid`, ghost zones are **cut from within** the provided coordinate arrays.
            The bounding box of the physical domain is **shrunk inward**, and the coordinate values at the edges
            are interpreted as the full ghost-inclusive domain.

        .. hint::

            If your coordinates represent **vertex points**, set ``center='vertex'`` and omit the bounding box.
            The grid will automatically derive the physical domain by slicing off ghost zones at the edges.

Setting up Chunking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Chunking is an optional feature that divides the grid into regularly sized subdomains, or "chunks".
This is useful for:

- Memory-efficient block processing
- Parallelization across chunks
- Defining update stencils and halo operations in localized regions

.. important::

    Chunking is always based on the **active domain** (excluding ghost zones). Each chunk
    must evenly divide the number of **active grid cells** along each axis.

To enable chunking, specify the ``chunk_size`` keyword when constructing the grid:

.. code-block:: python

    from pymetric.coordinates import CartesianCoordinateSystem2D
    from pymetric.grids import UniformGrid

    csys = CartesianCoordinateSystem2D()
    bbox = [[0, 0], [1, 1]]
    shape = [100, 100]  # active grid shape (no ghosts)

    grid = UniformGrid(
        csys,
        bbox,
        shape,
        chunk_size=[25, 25],        # splits into 4x4 chunks
        ghost_zones=[[2, 2], [2, 2]]
    )

.. note::

    Chunking does **not** affect the physical layout or coordinate values. It only partitions
    the grid into internal subregions for computational and data management purposes.

.. hint::

    You can inspect chunking-related attributes using:

    - :attr:`~grids.base.GridBase.chunking` → `True` or `False`
    - :attr:`~grids.base.GridBase.chunk_size` → shape of each chunk (e.g., `[25, 25]`)
    - :attr:`~grids.base.GridBase.cdd` → number of chunks per axis (chunk domain dimensions)

Cell Centered vs. Vertex Centered Grids
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All grids in PyMetric may be constructed in one of two centering modes:

- **Cell-Centered** (`center='cell'`):

  - Coordinates represent the center of each computational cell.
  - The number of coordinates equals the number of *cells*.
  - Requires a bounding box (`bbox`) to define the outer physical edges.
  - Common in finite-volume or control-volume methods.

- **Vertex-Centered** (`center='vertex'`):

  - Coordinates represent the edges or vertices between cells.
  - The number of coordinates is one more than the number of cells.
  - No bounding box is required; it is inferred from the vertex values.
  - Useful for spectral, finite-difference, or interpolation-heavy use cases.

You select the centering mode at construction using the ``center=`` keyword (default is `'vertex'`):

.. code-block:: python

    grid = GenericGrid(
        csys,
        [x, y],
        center='vertex',   # or 'cell'
        ghost_zones=[[2, 2], [2, 2]],
    )

.. hint::

    The attribute :meth:`~grids.base.GridBase.centering` reflects whether the grid is cell- or vertex-centered.

.. note::

    - The grid shape reported by :meth:`~grids.base.GridBase.dd` refers to the number of **active cells**, regardless of centering.
    - In vertex-centered grids, the coordinate arrays will have length ``dd + 1``.
    - In cell-centered grids, the coordinate arrays will match :meth:`~grids.base.GridBase.dd`.

Understanding the centering convention is critical for aligning data, especially when computing
differential operators or interpolating between grid-based quantities.

Using PyMetric Grids
--------------------

In the previous section, the classes of :mod:`grids` were introduced and
the details of creating them were covered. In this section, we'll look at some
of the capabilities of PyMetric grids.

In general, the most important function of PyMetric grids is to provide a backend
for the higher level classes of :mod:`fields`; however, these grids are often of
use on their own.

Extracting Coordinates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once a grid has been constructed, PyMetric provides a consistent and flexible API
for retrieving spatial coordinate values from the grid. Generically, 2 representations
for coordinates are supported:

- **coordinates**: When a method refers to generating "coordinates," this generally refers
  to producing a sequence of 1D arrays containing coordinate points along each axis of
  the grid.
- **meshes**: When a method refers to a "mesh," this generally to producing a sequence of ND arrays
  containing a full coordinate meshgrid for each axis. This is similar to :func:`numpy.meshgrid`.

In addition, coordinates can be extracted from both the full domain of the grid
and from particular chunks. PyMetric also allows users to fine tune the behavior of these
procedures to include (or exclude) ghost zones, support uniform "halos" around a particular
region, and various others.

.. important::

    Coordinate extraction always follows **logical axis order** as defined by the coordinate system,
    not NumPy memory layout. For Cartesian 2D, this is typically:

    - `x` → axis 0
    - `y` → axis 1

    This means that :meth:`~grids.base.GridBase.compute_domain_coords` returns `(x, y)`, where `x.shape = (nx,)` and `y.shape = (ny,)`.

    When plotting, transpose field data if needed for alignment:

    .. code-block:: python

        plt.imshow(field.T, extent=(x[0], x[-1], y[0], y[-1]))

Coordinates on the Full Grid
````````````````````````````

To start, let's look at extracting the coordinates for the entire domain of
a grid. This is accomplished using the :meth:`~grids.base.GridBase.compute_domain_coords` and :meth:`~grids.base.GridBase.compute_domain_mesh`:

.. plot::
    :include-source:

        from pymetric.coordinates import CartesianCoordinateSystem2D
        from pymetric.grids import UniformGrid
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import numpy as np

        csys = CartesianCoordinateSystem2D()
        bbox = [[0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0]]  # [lower_bounds, upper_bounds]
        shape = [100, 100]  # number of cells per axis

        grid = UniformGrid(
            csys,
            bbox,
            shape,
            ghost_zones=[[2, 2], [2, 2]]  # 2 ghost zones on each side
        )

        X,Y = grid.compute_domain_mesh()
        R = np.sqrt(X**2 + Y**2)
        Z = np.sin(10*R)

        plt.imshow(Z)
        plt.show()

For most general operations, these methods provide the easiest access point for performing
a computation on a grid.

Coordinates on Chunks
````````````````````````````

In chunked grids, you often want to extract coordinate arrays specific to a single chunk
(or a subset of chunks). This enables efficient block-wise computation, boundary-localized
operations, and tiled memory access patterns for large datasets.

To extract coordinates for a given chunk, use:

- :meth:`~grids.base.GridBase.compute_chunk_coords` — returns 1D coordinate arrays
- :meth:`~grids.base.GridBase.compute_chunk_mesh` — returns full meshgrid coordinates

.. code-block:: python

    coords = grid.compute_chunk_coords(
        chunks=[1, 2],              # the chunk index (i.e. 2nd chunk along axis 0, 3rd along axis 1)
        include_ghosts=True         # include ghost cells around the chunk
    )

    X, Y = grid.compute_chunk_mesh(
        chunks=[1, 2],
        include_ghosts=True
    )

You can also specify halo offsets, which add additional cells around each chunk beyond ghost zones:

.. code-block:: python

    coords = grid.compute_chunk_coords(
        chunks=[1, 1],
        halo_offsets=1              # one extra cell on each side (after ghost padding)
    )

    X, Y = grid.compute_chunk_mesh(
        chunks=[1, 1],
        halo_offsets=[[1, 1], [2, 2]]
    )

Returned coordinate arrays are always aligned to the global domain, and are consistent with
the buffer layout returned from chunk-level accessors (like :meth:`~grids.base.GridBase.empty_like_chunks`).

.. important::

    When computing coordinates for a chunk:

    - The chunk region is interpreted in **global index space** (including ghost zones).
    - Ghost and halo padding are applied *after* determining the base chunk bounds.
    - If the grid is vertex-centered, one extra index is added to include trailing vertices.

    These default behaviors can be modified with specific kwargs passed to the relevant methods.
    See API documentation for more.


Performing Operations On Coordinates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In most workflows, the best approach for working with grid coordinates is to extract them
via the mesh or coordinate generation functions as described above. There are a few utilities which
have built in support which we will summarize here.

The first of these is computing functions over the grid. This is performed using the :meth:`~grids.base.GridBase.compute_function_on_grid`
with the following syntax:

.. code-block:: python

    from pymetric import UniformGrid, CartesianCoordinateSystem2D
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    cs = CartesianCoordinateSystem2D()
    bbox = [[0,1],[0,1]]
    dd = [10000,10000]
    grid = UniformGrid(cs, bbox, dd, chunk_size=(10,10),center='cell')

    func = lambda x,y: np.sin(10*np.sqrt(x**2+y**2))
    Z = grid.compute_function_on_grid(func,in_chunks=True)

    plt.imshow(Z)
    plt.show()

For more advanced computations over the grid, it usually suffices to simply extract the coordinates; however,
users may also take advantage of methods like :meth:`A.iter_chunk_coords` to perform memory intensive operations in
chunks. See the chunking section below for more details.

Differential Geometry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. hint::

    For low-level details and reference implementations, see :mod:`differential_geometry`.

Grids in PyMetric support direct computation of differential geometric operations, including
gradients, divergences, and Laplacians, on structured domains. These methods build upon
PyMetric’s coordinate-aware differential geometry engine and are designed to work
seamlessly with both full-domain and chunked workflows.

.. important::

    Differential geometry in PyMetric is organized into three layers of abstraction:

    - **Low-level operations** (:mod:`differential_geometry`): Direct numerical methods requiring manual specification of coordinate arrays, metric tensors, and transformation terms.
    - **Grid-level operations** (:mod:`grids`): High-level APIs that automatically compute coordinate-dependent terms using the grid's geometry and coordinate system.
    - **Field-level operations** (:mod:`fields`): Fully automated routines that handle axis alignment, symbolic dependence tracking, and term inference for derived fields.

As the intermediate layer, grids are ideal when you want more control than fields provide but without manually constructing all geometric data.

Setting Up Differential Computations
````````````````````````````````````

To perform a differential operation at the grid level, you generally need to provide the following:

1. **A field** (`field`) — The data array on which the differential operation will be performed.
   This can be any NumPy-like array (does not need to be a `Field` object). You must also specify the axes
   of the grid that the field spans using the `field_axes` argument.

   .. note::

       `field_axes` is a list of logical axis names (e.g., `["x", "y"]`) that describe how the
       field maps onto the grid’s coordinate system. The axes must be consistent with the grid's coordinate system.

2. **An output axis specification** (`output_axes`) — A list of axes that the result of the operation will span.
   In general, this should be a **superset** of `field_axes`. This accounts for the fact that many geometric
   operations (e.g., gradients) increase tensor rank or introduce new directional components.

   For example, computing the gradient of a scalar field with `field_axes=["x", "y"]` might yield
   an output with `output_axes=["x", "y", "r"]`, where `"r"` indexes the coordinate directions.


Most differential methods also support the following optional keyword arguments:

- ``in_chunks`` (bool): Whether to compute the result one chunk at a time, useful for large domains.
- ``edge_order`` (int): Numerical stencil order used for computing finite differences (usually 1 or 2).
- ``pbar`` (bool): Whether to show a progress bar when chunking is enabled.
- ``out`` (array, optional): Pre-allocated output array to store the result.
- ``output_element_shape`` (tuple, optional): The shape of the tensor component at each grid point.

These options allow fine-tuned control over memory usage, numerical accuracy, and parallelization behavior.
See the method-level documentation for more details on inputs and behavior. A full list of supported operations
is provided below in this section. As an example, the gradient in cartesian coordinates might look like

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    from pymetric import UniformGrid, CartesianCoordinateSystem2D
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    # Build the coordinate system
    # and the grid.
    cs = CartesianCoordinateSystem2D()
    bbox = [[-1,1],[-1,1]]
    dd = [1000,1000]
    grid = UniformGrid(cs, bbox, dd,
                       chunk_size=(10,10),
                       center='cell')

    # Generate the function Z(X,Y).
    func = lambda x,y: np.sin(10*np.sqrt(x**2+y**2))
    Z = grid.compute_function_on_grid(func)

    # Compute the covariant gradient.
    gradZ = grid.dense_covariant_gradient(Z,['x','y'])

    # Plot the x and y components.
    fig,axes = plt.subplots(1,3,figsize=(10,4),sharex=True,sharey=True)
    axes[0].imshow(Z.T,extent=(-1,1,-1,1),cmap='inferno')
    axes[1].imshow(gradZ[...,0].T,extent=(-1,1,-1,1),cmap='inferno')
    axes[2].imshow(gradZ[...,1].T,extent=(-1,1,-1,1),cmap='inferno')
    plt.show()

Interpolation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Grids in PyMetric provide built-in support for fast, local interpolation over either the full domain
or individual chunks. This is useful for evaluating continuous functions from discrete field data,
implementing semi-Lagrangian schemes, sampling initial conditions, or querying solution values at arbitrary coordinates.

Interpolation in PyMetric is powered by SciPy's :class:`scipy.interpolate.RegularGridInterpolator`, wrapped
in a grid-aware API that handles coordinate extraction and axis alignment automatically.

To build an interpolator over the entire active domain of the grid, use :meth:`~grids.base.GridBase.construct_domain_interpolator`:

.. code-block:: python

    interpolator = grid.construct_domain_interpolator(
        field,                # array shaped according to field_axes
        field_axes,           # e.g., ["x", "y"]
        method="linear",      # or "nearest"
        bounds_error=False,
        fill_value=np.nan
    )

This returns a callable object that can be used like:

.. code-block:: python

    # Evaluate at a batch of (x, y) points
    points = np.array([[0.1, 0.2], [0.5, 0.7]])
    values = interpolator(points)

The `field_axes` argument must match the ordering of dimensions in `field`, and those axes must align
with the grid’s coordinate system.

.. note::

    The interpolator operates in physical coordinates (e.g., meters, centimeters) — not index space.
    You must provide real-space locations for evaluation.

To create an interpolator for a specific region of the grid (a "chunk"), use :meth:`~grids.base.GridBase.construct_chunk_interpolator`:

.. code-block:: python

    interpolator = grid.construct_chunk_interpolator(
        field_chunk,            # array sliced to match the chunk
        field_axes,             # e.g., ["x", "y"]
        chunks=[1, 2],          # chunk index along each axis
        include_ghosts=True,    # include ghost zones if needed
        halo_offsets=[1, 1],    # optional halo padding
        method="linear"
    )

This is ideal for distributed, tiled, or stencil-based algorithms that operate on chunked regions
of the domain. The interpolation region automatically accounts for ghost zones and halos.

.. hint::

    The `field_chunk` must already be sliced to match the shape of the specified chunk region,
    including any ghost or halo padding. Use :meth:`~grids.base.GridBase.compute_chunk_slice`
    and `field[chunk_slice]` to extract it.

Units and Unit Systems
-----------------------

PyMetric grids support *unit-aware metadata* for spatial dimensions, allowing users to attach
physical units (e.g., ``"cm"``, ``"m"``, ``"rad"``) to each coordinate axis of a grid. This metadata is used
to define a consistent internal **unit system**, which is available for inspection and integration
into downstream operations, such as:

- Unit-aware field creation or evaluation
- Differential operator scaling
- Serialization and I/O
- Visualization annotations

However, **PyMetric does not enforce unit conversion or operate directly with `unyt` arrays** inside the grid
infrastructure itself. All numerical operations on grids are performed using plain NumPy arrays, with
units treated as optional metadata.

Why This Matters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This design provides a clean separation between **physical interpretation** and **computational logic**.
It ensures that PyMetric grids remain:

- **Lightweight and efficient**: Coordinates are stored and manipulated as raw NumPy arrays without the overhead
  of unit-tagged computation.
- **Flexible**: Users can choose whether to operate in raw or unit-aware workflows without performance penalties.
- **Explicit and transparent**: Units are always available to the user but are not silently applied in operations
  unless explicitly handled at a higher level (e.g., in :mod:`fields`).

This allows PyMetric grids to work seamlessly with performance-critical applications (e.g., solvers, data ingestion,
visualization) while still supporting scientific correctness when units are needed.

Accessing Units
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each grid maintains two unit-related properties:

- :attr:`~grids.base.GridBase.unit_system` — a `unyt.UnitSystem` object defining base units (length, mass, time, etc.)
- :attr:`~grids.base.GridBase.axes_units` — a list of `unyt.Unit` objects representing the unit of each coordinate axis

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    grid.unit_system
    # → UnitSystem(name='_grid_units', length_unit=cm, time_unit=s, mass_unit=g, angle_unit=rad, ...)

    grid.axes_units
    # → [unyt.cm, unyt.cm]  (for a 2D Cartesian grid with length units in cm)

Setting Units
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can provide custom units when constructing a grid:

.. code-block:: python

    grid = UniformGrid(
        coordinate_system=cs,
        bbox=[[0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0]],
        shape=[100, 100],
        units={"length": "m"}  # Use meters instead of the default cm
    )

Supported base unit types are:

- ``length`` (e.g., "m", "cm")
- ``time`` (e.g., "s")
- ``mass`` (e.g., "kg", "g")
- ``angle`` (e.g., "rad", "deg")

These units are used to interpret physical dimensions in the coordinate system and are embedded
in serialization metadata (e.g., HDF5 files).

Best Practices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Use units when **sharing grids**, saving to disk, or interoperating with unit-aware fields.
- Omit units when **maximum performance** is desired and you're operating within a consistent internal convention.
- Prefer fields (:mod:`fields`) for operations that require strict unit propagation.

.. warning::

   Units are **not applied automatically** in grid-level numerical methods (e.g., gradients or interpolators).
   Ensure consistency in your workflows if you perform manual scaling or interpret raw coordinate values.
