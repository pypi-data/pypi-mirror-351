Core Modules: Coordinate Systems
================================

This gallery highlights examples built around the :mod:`coordinates` module, PyMetric's foundation
for defining and working with structured coordinate systems.

The :mod:`coordinates` module provides a flexible API for defining Cartesian,
polar, cylindrical, spherical, and general curvilinear systems,
as well as custom user-defined coordinates. These examples showcase how to:

- Instantiate and explore predefined coordinate systems,
- Evaluate coordinate transforms and Jacobians,
- Work with symbolic metrics and basis vectors,
- Integrate coordinate systems into grid construction and field definitions.

Whether you're visualizing a spherical metric or customizing an orthogonal system for a simulation,
these examples serve as practical guides to mastering the geometry backbone of PyMetric.
