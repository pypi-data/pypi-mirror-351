Example Gallery
==================

Welcome to the **PyMetric Example Gallery**!

This section showcases a curated collection of concise, self-contained examples demonstrating
core features and capabilities of the PyMetric library. Whether you're exploring differential geometry
on structured grids, manipulating tensor fields, or performing symbolic and numerical calculations in curvilinear coordinates,
these examples are designed to help you learn by doing.

Each script is:

- Minimal and focused on a single concept,
- Ready to run and modify interactively,
- Accompanied by inline explanations and visual outputs when appropriate.

Browse through, try them out, and use them as starting points for your own work.
