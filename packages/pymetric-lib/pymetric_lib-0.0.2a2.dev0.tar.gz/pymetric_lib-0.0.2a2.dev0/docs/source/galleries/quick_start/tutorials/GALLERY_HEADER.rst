.. warning::

    This section of documentation is under development.

The **PyMetric Tutorials** provide guided, narrative-based walkthroughs that
cover broader topics and workflows. They’re ideal for:

- 🧠 Learning concepts behind structured differential geometry and physical fields
- 🛠️ Building intuition about PyMetric’s abstractions
- 🧪 Developing domain-specific simulations or visualizations

These tutorials go beyond isolated examples by combining multiple features of
PyMetric into coherent, real-world scenarios.
