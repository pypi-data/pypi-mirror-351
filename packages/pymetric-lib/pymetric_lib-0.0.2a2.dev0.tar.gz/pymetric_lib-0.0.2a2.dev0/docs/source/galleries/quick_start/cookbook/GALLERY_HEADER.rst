    This section of documentation is under development.

Welcome to the **PyMetric Cookbook** — a curated collection of short, practical examples
designed to illustrate common tasks, patterns, and utilities within the PyMetric ecosystem.

Unlike full tutorials, each recipe focuses on a **specific task** or use case and is
meant to be **easy to read and directly usable** in your own workflows.

What You'll Find
+++++++++++++++++

- 📐 Coordinate system manipulations (e.g., create custom orthogonal systems)
- 🧮 Grid setup for structured domains (uniform, scaled, and ghost-zoned)
- 📊 Field initialization, slicing, and unit handling
- 📤 Buffer conversions and HDF5-backed I/O
- ⚙️ Applying differential geometry operations (gradient, divergence, Laplacian)
- 🧪 Testing and validating geometric correctness

Each recipe is self-contained and includes minimal setup, input/output descriptions, and
short code blocks. Think of these as your "how do I...?" reference section.
