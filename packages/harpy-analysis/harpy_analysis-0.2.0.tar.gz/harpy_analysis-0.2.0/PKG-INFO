        13.	The user will indemnify, defend and hold harmless VIB, its directors, officers, employees and agents from and against all liability, losses, damages and expenses (including attorney’s fees and costs) arising out of any claims, demands, actions or other proceedings made or instituted by any third party against any of them and arising out of or relating to any breach of this Agreement by the user, or any use of the Licensed Software by the user, except insofar as such claims or liability result from VIB’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.
        14.	This Agreement and the license rights granted herein shall become effective as of the date the user downloaded the Licensed Software and shall continue in full force until the user deletes the Licensed Software and any and all related files from the user’s computing system, unless terminated in accordance with this Section. Upon one party's breach of any agreement, covenant, or representation made in this Agreement, the agreement will automatically end thirty (30) days after such breach.

This Agreement cannot be modified except in writing and signed by both parties. Failure by either party at any time to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver by such party of such provision nor in any way affect the validity of this Agreement.
        17.	The invalidity of singular provisions does not affect the validity of the entire understanding. The parties are obligated, however, to replace the invalid provisions by a regulation, which comes closest to the economic intent of the invalid provision. The same shall apply mutatis mutandis in case of a gap.
