# H0lwin - Just for Fun, but Kind of Cool 😎

> A personal and fun Python module for experimenting, testing, and learning how to publish on PyPI — made by [H0lwin](https://t.me/H0lwin_P) from Shiraz, Iran 🇮🇷.

## 📦 What is this?

**H0lwin** is a fun and totally useless (yet kind of useful) Python module I created as a **test project** to learn how to publish Python packages on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).

But hey — you can still install it, use it, explore it, and even learn from it!

## 🧠 Why did I make this?

- To learn **how to structure, build, and upload** a Python package to PyPI.
- To play around with modules, metadata, and distribution tools.
- To give the world a tiny piece of myself, just for fun 😄.

## 🔧 What does it do?

This module contains a bunch of fake/fun functions that return:

- My name, age, city, country
- Skills like programming languages
- My personality
- Dev setup info (OS, editor, etc.)
- ...and more random/fun details.

Use it to:

- See how importing and using custom modules works
- Learn how to structure and explore Python packages
- Use in tutorials, demos, or even prank your friends 👻

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
pip install h0lwin
```

## 🧪 Usage

```python
from h0lwin import info, age, city, skills, os, github

print(info())       # Get full profile info
print(age())        # Just the age
print(skills())     # List of coding skills
print(os())         # Dev environment
print(github())     # GitHub profile
```

You can also explore more by checking the __init__.py inside the module.

📚 Learn from It
This module is open source and easy to read. If you’re new to packaging in Python, you can:

Look at the setup.py file to see how metadata is defined.

See how to use README.md for PyPI descriptions.

Explore the module structure and __init__.py.
