Fix release issue (#1598)

# Description

The release process failed for the last release due to writing `No
changes` instead of `No changes` in the cdf section. This PR fixes that
issue. We need to repeat the changelog and bump from the failing release
to trigger a new one:

## Changelog

- [x] Patch
- [ ] Minor
- [ ] Skip

## cdf

No changes

## templates

### Fixed

- Bootcamp config.test.yaml had incorrect credentials for workflow
variables
- fixed bug that would miss list of datapoints when list was < 50
