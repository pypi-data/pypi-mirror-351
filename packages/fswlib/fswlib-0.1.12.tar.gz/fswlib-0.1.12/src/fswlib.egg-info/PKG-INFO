# Fourier Sliced-Wasserstein (FSW) embedding — a PyTorch-based library

This package provides an implementation of the **Fourier Sliced-Wasserstein (FSW) embedding** for multisets and measures, introduced in our [ICLR 2025 paper](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2025/poster/30562):

## 🔧 Installation

To install the package:

```bash
pip install fswlib
```

This package includes an optional custom CUDA implementation. When working with sparse weight matrices (e.g., sparse graphs), it can be approximately 2× faster than the pure-PyTorch implementation.  
To compile it, run:

```bash
fswlib-build
```
