# pyfisheye

**pyfisheye** is a Python library for automatic calibration of fisheye and omnidirectional cameras, offering fast and accurate mapping between image and world coordinates.

It is based on:
- [Scaramuzza et al., "Omnidirectional Camera Calibration," IEEE IROS 2006](https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2006.282372)
- [Urban et al., "Improved omnidirectional camera calibration," ISPRS Journal 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2015.06.005)

## Features

- Automatic camera calibration.
- Accurate mapping between image and world coordinates.
- Support for fisheye and omnidirectional lenses.
- Tools for projection and visualization.
