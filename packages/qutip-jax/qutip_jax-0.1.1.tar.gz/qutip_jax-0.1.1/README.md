qutip-jax: JAX backend for QuTiP
================================

A plug-in for [QuTiP](https://qutip.org) providing a [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) linear-algebra backend.
Backing the linear algebra operations with JAX extends QuTiP's
capability to work with a GPU. Furthermore, it allows QuTiP's `Qobj` class to
benefit from [auto differentiation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/autodiff_cookbook.html).

We are actively developing the plug-in and in the pre-alpha state. Therefore it is a work-in-progress and is not ready for use yet. You are welcome to contribute or take part in the development by posting issues, PRs and through discussions.
