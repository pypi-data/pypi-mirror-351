<h3> ML model optimization product to accelerate inference </h3>

## ðŸš¨ 2025 End of Life Announcement: DeepSparse, SparseML, SparseZoo, and Sparsify

Dear Community,

Weâ€™re reaching out with heartfelt thanks and important news. Following [Neural Magicâ€™s acquisition by Red Hat in January 2025](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-completes-acquisition-neural-magic-fuel-optimized-generative-ai-innovation-across-hybrid-cloud), weâ€™ve shifted our focus to commercial and open-source offerings built around [vLLM (virtual large language models)](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/ai/what-is-vllm).

As part of this transition, we ceased development and deprecated the community versions of **DeepSparse (including DeepSparse Enterprise), SparseML, SparseZoo, and Sparsify on June 2, 2025**. These tools no longer will receive updates or support.

From day one, our mission was to democratize AI through efficient, accessible tools. Weâ€™ve learned so much from your feedback, creativity, and collaborationâ€”watching these tools become vital parts of your ML journeys has meant the world to us.

Though weâ€™re winding down the community editions, we remain committed to our original values. Now as part of Red Hat, weâ€™re excited to evolve our work around vLLM and deliver even more powerful solutions to the ML community.

To learn more about our next chapter, visit [ai.redhat.com](ai.redhat.com). Thank you for being part of this incredible journey.

_With gratitude, The Neural Magic Team (now part of Red Hat)_
