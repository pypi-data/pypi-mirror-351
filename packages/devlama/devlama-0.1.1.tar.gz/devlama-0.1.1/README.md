# PyLama - Python Code Generation with Ollama

PyLama is a Python tool that leverages Ollama's language models to generate and execute Python code. It simplifies the process of writing and running Python scripts by handling dependency management and code execution automatically. With the template system, it generates higher quality, platform-aware code that's ready to run. PyLama is part of the PyLama ecosystem and integrates with LogLama as the primary service for centralized logging and environment management.

## Features

- **Real Ollama Integration**: Uses real Ollama models to generate high-quality Python code
- **Automatic Model Installation**: Automatically installs models when requested, including special handling for SpeakLeash/Bielik models
- **Mock Mode**: Supports a mock mode for testing without requiring Ollama
- **Smart Model Selection**: Automatically selects the best available model with fallbacks
- **Progress Indicator**: Shows real-time progress during code generation
- **Template System**: Generates code with awareness of platform, dependencies, and more
- **Interactive Mode**: Provides an interactive CLI for model selection and code generation
- **Code Execution**: Can execute generated code directly
- **LogLama Integration**: Integrates with LogLama for centralized logging, environment management, and service orchestration
- **Structured Logging**: All operations are logged with component context for better debugging and monitoring

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) installed and running (unless using mock mode)
- One or more code generation models pulled in Ollama (e.g., `codellama:7b`, `phi3:latest`)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/py-lama/pylama.git
cd pylama

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies in development mode
pip install -e .  # This is important! Always install in development mode before starting
```

> **IMPORTANT**: Always run `pip install -e .` before starting any project in the PyLama ecosystem. This ensures all dependencies are properly installed and the package is available in development mode.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Generate code using the default model
pylama "create a function to calculate fibonacci numbers"

# Generate and run code
pylama -r "create a web server with Flask"

# Save generated code to a file
pylama -s "create a script to download files from URLs"

# Use a specific model
pylama --model codellama:7b "create a binary search tree implementation"

# Use mock mode (no Ollama required)
pylama --mock "print hello world"

# Use a model that will be automatically installed if not available
pylama --model SpeakLeash/bielik-1.5b-v3.0-instruct-gguf "print hello world"
```

### Interactive Mode

```bash
# Start interactive mode
pylama -i

# Start interactive mode with mock implementation
pylama -i --mock
```

## Ollama Integration

PyLama integrates with Ollama to provide high-quality code generation. By default, it will:

1. Connect to the Ollama server running on `localhost:11434`
2. Check if the requested model is available
3. **Automatically install the model** if it's not available and auto-install is enabled
4. **Automatically select an available model** if the requested one isn't found
5. Use the best available model for code generation
6. Fall back to alternative models if needed
7. Display a progress spinner with elapsed time during code generation

### Setting Up Ollama

```bash
# Install Ollama (if not already installed)
# See https://ollama.ai for installation instructions

# Start the Ollama server
ollama serve

# Pull recommended models for code generation
ollama pull codellama:7b
ollama pull phi3:latest
```

### Automatic Model Installation

PyLama can automatically install models when requested:

```bash
# This will automatically download and install the model if not available
pylama --model SpeakLeash/bielik-1.5b-v3.0-instruct-gguf "print hello world"
```

#### SpeakLeash/Bielik Models

PyLama has enhanced support for SpeakLeash/Bielik models with the following features:

1. **Automatic Installation**: Downloads and installs the model from Hugging Face when first requested
2. **Model Reuse**: Detects existing Bielik installations to avoid redundant downloads
3. **Extended Timeouts**: Automatically increases API timeout to 120 seconds for these larger models

Example output:
```
Found existing Bielik model installation: bielik-custom-1747866289:latest
Using existing model instead of downloading again.
Increased API timeout to 120 seconds for Bielik model.
                                                                        
Generated Python code:
----------------------------------------
#!/bin/env python3
import sys, os

# Function to check if the operating system is Linux
def is_linux():
    return os.name == 'posix' and sys.platform == 'linux'

if not is_linux():
    print("This code requires a Linux operating system to run.")
    exit()

# Hello World function
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Call the hello_world function
    hello_world()
----------------------------------------
```

PyLama's installation process for SpeakLeash/Bielik models:

1. Downloads the model file from Hugging Face
2. Creates a custom Modelfile with appropriate parameters
3. Creates the model in Ollama with a unique name
4. Updates your environment settings to use the new model
5. Remembers the model for future use to avoid redundant downloads

For more details on working with Bielik models, see [BIELIK.txt](BIELIK.txt).

### Environment Variables

You can configure PyLama using environment variables:

- `OLLAMA_PATH`: Path to the Ollama executable (default: `ollama`)
- `OLLAMA_MODEL`: Default model to use (default: `codellama:7b`)
- `OLLAMA_FALLBACK_MODELS`: Comma-separated list of fallback models (default: `codellama:7b,phi3:latest,tinyllama:latest`)
- `OLLAMA_AUTO_SELECT_MODEL`: Whether to automatically select an available model when the specified one isn't found (default: `True`)
- `OLLAMA_AUTO_INSTALL_MODEL`: Whether to automatically install a model when it's not found (default: `True`)
- `OLLAMA_TIMEOUT`: API timeout in seconds (default: `30`, recommended `120` for Bielik models)

## Troubleshooting

### Model Not Found

If you see an error like this:

```
Model 'your-model-name' not found in Ollama. Available models: ['codellama:7b', 'phi3:latest']
```

You can either:

1. Pull the model manually:
   ```bash
   ollama pull your-model-name
   ```

2. Enable automatic model installation (already enabled by default):
   ```bash
   export OLLAMA_AUTO_INSTALL_MODEL=true
   ```

### Connection Timeout

If you see a timeout error:

```
Error querying Ollama API: HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=11434): Read timed out. (read timeout=30)
```

Make sure Ollama is running:

```bash
ollama serve
```

If Ollama is running but still timing out, try increasing the timeout:

```bash
export OLLAMA_TIMEOUT=120  # Recommended for larger models like Bielik
```

Note: PyLama now automatically increases the timeout to 120 seconds for Bielik models, but you may need to set this manually for other large models.

### Duplicate Model Downloads

If you notice that PyLama is downloading the same model multiple times:

1. For SpeakLeash/Bielik models, PyLama now automatically detects existing installations
2. For other models, ensure you're using the exact same model name each time
3. Check your Ollama installation with `ollama list` to see all installed models

## Mock Mode

PyLama includes a mock mode that doesn't require Ollama to be installed or running. This is useful for testing or when you don't have access to Ollama.

```bash
pylama --mock "print hello world"
```

In mock mode, PyLama will return pre-defined code examples based on the prompt.

## Troubleshooting

### Model Not Found

If you see an error like this:

```
Model 'your-model-name' not found in Ollama. Available models: ['codellama:7b', 'phi3:latest']
```

You need to pull the model first:

```bash
ollama pull your-model-name
```

### Connection Timeout

If you see a timeout error:

```
Error querying Ollama API: HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=11434): Read timed out. (read timeout=30)
```

Make sure Ollama is running:

```bash
ollama serve
```

If Ollama is running but still timing out, the model might be too large for your system. Try using a smaller model:

```bash
pylama --model tinyllama:latest "your prompt"
```

## PyLama Microservices Architecture

## Overview

This repository contains a microservices-based architecture for the PyLama ecosystem, consisting of the following components:

- **PyBox**: Python code execution sandbox
- **PyLLM**: LLM operations service
- **PyLama**: Ollama management service
- **SheLLama**: Shell and filesystem operations service
- **APILama**: API gateway for all services
- **WebLama**: Web frontend (JavaScript/HTML/CSS)

The architecture has been refactored to improve maintainability, scalability, and separation of concerns. Each component now exposes a REST API that can be consumed by other services through the APILama gateway.

## Architecture

The PyLama ecosystem is built around a central orchestration service (PyLama) that coordinates all other components. This architecture allows for better integration and simplified deployment.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose (recommended for easy deployment)
- Python 3.8 or higher (for development without Docker)
- Node.js 14 or higher (for WebLama frontend development)
- Git

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the entire PyLama ecosystem is using Docker Compose, which will set up all components with the correct configuration and dependencies.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/py-lama/pylama.git
   cd py-lama
   ```

2. Start all services with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   This will start all components in the correct order with PyLama as the central orchestration point.

3. Access the web interface:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:80`

4. Monitor the logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

5. Stop all services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

### Manual Installation (Development)

For development purposes, you can set up each component individually.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/py-lama/pylama.git
   cd py-lama
   ```

2. Set up each component:

   #### PyLama (Central Orchestration Service)
   ```bash
   cd pylama
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e .
   ```

   #### APILama (API Gateway)
   ```bash
   cd apilama
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e .
   ```

   #### SheLLama (Shell Operations)
   ```bash
   cd shellama
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e .
   ```

   #### PyBox (Sandbox)
   ```bash
   cd pybox
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e .
   ```

   #### PyLLM (LLM Operations)
   ```bash
   cd pyllm
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e .
   ```

   #### WebLama (Frontend)
   ```bash
   cd weblama
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Services Manually

If you're not using Docker, start the services in the following order:

1. **PyBox** (Sandbox):
   ```bash
   cd pybox
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   python -m pybox.app --port 8000 --host 127.0.0.1
   ```

2. **PyLLM** (LLM Operations):
   ```bash
   cd pyllm
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   python -m pyllm.app --port 8001 --host 127.0.0.1
   ```

3. **APILama** (API Gateway):
   ```bash
   cd apilama
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   python -m apilama.app --port 8080 --host 127.0.0.1
   ```
   Note: APILama will automatically use SheLLama as a library.

4. **PyLama** (Central Orchestration):
   ```bash
   cd pylama
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   python -m pylama.app --port 8003 --host 127.0.0.1
   ```
   PyLama coordinates all other services and provides a unified interface.

5. **WebLama** (Frontend):
   ```bash
   cd weblama
   npm start
   ```
   Or serve the static files with a web server of your choice.

6. Access the web interface:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or whatever port you configured for the WebLama frontend)

## Development

### Adding a New Service

To add a new service to the ecosystem:

1. Create a new directory for your service
2. Implement the service with a REST API
3. Add routes to APILama to proxy requests to your service
4. Update the WebLama frontend to interact with your service through APILama

### Testing

Each service has its own test suite. To run the tests for a service:

```bash
cd <service-directory>
python -m unittest discover tests
```

To run the integration tests for the entire ecosystem:

```bash
python integration_test.py
```

## Benefits of the Microservices Architecture

1. **Modularity**: Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
2. **Scalability**: Services can be scaled based on demand
3. **Maintainability**: Clearer separation of concerns
4. **Deployment Flexibility**: Components can be deployed separately or together
5. **Language Agnostic**: Future components could be written in different languages


## Using the Makefile

PyLama includes a Makefile to simplify common development tasks:

```bash
# Set up the project (creates a virtual environment and installs dependencies)
make setup

# Run the API server (default port 8002)
make run

# Run the API server on a custom port
make run PORT=8080

# The run-port command is also available for backward compatibility
make run-port PORT=8080

# Run tests
make test

# Format code with black
make format

# Lint code with flake8
make lint

# Clean up project (remove __pycache__, etc.)
make clean

# Show all available commands
make help
```

## Docker Testing Infrastructure

The PyLama ecosystem includes a comprehensive Docker testing infrastructure for all components. This allows for isolated testing of individual components as well as integration testing across the entire ecosystem.

### Docker Test Files

Each component (PyLama, PyBox, PyLLM, APILama, WebLama) includes the following Docker testing files:

- **Dockerfile.test**: Defines the test environment with all necessary dependencies
- **docker-compose.test.yml**: Configures the test services with proper networking and dependencies
- **run_docker_tests.sh**: Provides a convenient script to build, run, and manage the Docker test environment

### Running Docker Tests

To run tests using the Docker infrastructure:

```bash
# Build and run all tests
./run_docker_tests.sh --build --run-tests

# Start in interactive mode
./run_docker_tests.sh --interactive

# Start all services in the PyLama ecosystem
./run_docker_tests.sh --full-stack

# Run integration tests with all services
./run_docker_tests.sh --integration

# Run Ansible tests for comprehensive integration testing
./run_docker_tests.sh --ansible-tests

# Stop containers
./run_docker_tests.sh --stop

# Clean up containers and volumes
./run_docker_tests.sh --clean
```

### Ansible Integration Tests

The PyLama ecosystem includes Ansible playbooks for comprehensive integration testing:

- **ansible_tests/playbooks/**: Contains test playbooks for each component
- **ansible_tests/inventory/**: Defines the inventory for local testing
- **ansible_tests/templates/**: Includes templates for generating test reports

These tests verify that all components work together correctly, testing endpoints and interactions between services.

### Benefits of Docker Testing

1. **Isolated Environment**: Tests run in a clean, isolated environment
2. **Reproducibility**: Tests produce consistent results across different systems
3. **Integration Testing**: Easily test interactions between multiple services
4. **CI/CD Ready**: Docker tests can be integrated into continuous integration pipelines
5. **Mock Services**: Components can use mock implementations for faster testing

## Project Structure and Dependencies

PyLama is built on a modular architecture with three main components:

### Implementation Details

#### PyLama Core (pylama.py)

The core module coordinates all functionality:

- **check_ollama()**: Verifies Ollama is running
- **generate_code()**: Generates Python code from prompts
- **execute_code()**: Executes the generated code
- **save_code_to_file()**: Saves code to a file

#### Template System (templates.py)

Provides templates for different code generation scenarios:

- **basic**: Simple code generation
- **platform_aware**: Adapts code to the current platform
- **dependency_aware**: Includes necessary dependencies
- **testable**: Includes unit tests
- **secure**: Adds security checks
- **performance**: Optimizes for performance
- **pep8**: Follows PEP 8 style guidelines

#### Dependency Management

PyLama uses a sophisticated dependency management system:

1. **Direct Dependencies**:
   - **PyLama** depends on core Python libraries and utilities like `requests` and `python-dotenv`
   - Development dependencies include `pytest`, `black`, and `flake8`

2. **External Package Dependencies**:
   - **PyLLM**: Used for model management and LLM integration
   - **PyBox**: Used for code execution and sandbox functionality

3. **Dynamic Import System**:
   - PyLama uses dynamic imports to locate and use PyLLM and PyBox
   - The system first tries to find packages in the standard Python path
   - If not found, it looks for them in the parent directory (development mode)
   - This approach allows flexibility in both development and production environments

### Installation Process

PyLama can be installed in two ways:

#### 1. Development Mode

For development, all three packages (PyLama, PyLLM, PyBox) should be installed in development mode:

```bash
# Clone the repositories
git clone https://github.com/py-lama/pylama.git
git clone https://github.com/py-lama/pyllm.git
git clone https://github.com/py-lama/pybox.git

# Install in development mode
cd py-lama/pylama
pip install -e .
cd ../../pyllm
pip install -e .
cd ../pybox
pip install -e .
```

This setup allows changes in any package to be immediately available to the others.

#### 2. Production Installation

For end users, PyLama can be installed directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install pylama
```

This will install PyLama along with its dependencies, including PyLLM and PyBox.

## Examples

```bash
# After installation
pylama "create a simple hello world program"

# Or run directly from the source directory
python -m pylama.cli "create a simple hello world program"
```

This will generate a Python script that prints "Hello, World!" and execute it.

### Interactive Mode

```bash
pylama -i
```

This launches PyLama in interactive mode, allowing you to:
- Generate code with different prompts
- Switch between models
- Change templates
- Save and run generated code

### Specifying a Template

```bash
pylama -t dependency_aware -d "requests,beautifulsoup4" "create a web scraper for news headlines"
```

This will generate a web scraper using the specified dependencies.

### Additional Options

```bash
pylama -m "codellama:7b" -t testable -s -r "create a function to calculate fibonacci numbers"
```

This will:
- Use the codellama:7b model
- Generate code with the testable template
- Save the code to a file (-s)
- Run the generated code (-r)

- `prompt`: The task description for code generation (can be provided as positional arguments)
- `-t, --template`: Choose a template type for code generation (default: platform_aware)
  - Available templates: basic, platform_aware, dependency_aware, testable, secure, performance, pep8
- `-d, --dependencies`: Specify allowed dependencies (for dependency_aware template)
- `-m, --model`: Specify which Ollama model to use (default: llama3)
