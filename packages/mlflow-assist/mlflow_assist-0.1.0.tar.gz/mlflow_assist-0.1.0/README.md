A comprehensive enterprise-ready toolkit that supercharges your ML and LLM development workflow with automated optimization, deployment, monitoring, and monetization capabilities.

## 🌟 Key Features

### AutoML & Model Management
- 🤖 Automated model selection and optimization
- 📊 Hyperparameter optimization with Optuna
- 🔧 Model compression (pruning, quantization, distillation)
- 🚀 Distributed training with multi-GPU support

### LLM Capabilities
- 🧠 Advanced prompt engineering and chain management
- 🔄 Multi-step reasoning chains
- 💬 Conversation history management
- 🎯 Context-aware processing

### Enterprise Features
- 💰 Usage tracking and monetization
- 📊 Real-time performance monitoring
- 🔄 Automated deployment (K8s/Docker)
- 📈 Model drift detection & alerts

## 💻 Quick Start

### AutoML Example
```python
from mlflow_assist.advanced.automl import AutoML, AutoMLConfig

# Automated model selection and optimization
automl = AutoML(AutoMLConfig(task_type="classification"))
best_model = automl.optimize(X_train, y_train)

# Model compression and optimization
from mlflow_assist.advanced.optimization import ModelOptimizer
optimizer = ModelOptimizer(compression_method="quantization")
optimized_model = optimizer.optimize(model)
```

### LLM Chain Example
```python
from mlflow_assist.advanced.llm_chains import LLMChain

chain = LLMChain("gpt-3.5-turbo")
chain.add_prompt_template("""
Context: {context}
Question: {question}
Answer:""")

# Execute multi-step chains
pipeline = chain.create_chain([
    {"template": "Summarize: {text}", "use_response_as_input": True},
    {"template": "Extract key points: {text}"}
])
```

### Enterprise Features Example
```python
# Usage tracking and monetization
from mlflow_assist.enterprise.monetization import EnterpriseManager
manager = EnterpriseManager(subscription_plan="pro")
manager.track_usage("api_calls")

# Performance monitoring
from mlflow_assist.enterprise.monitoring import PerformanceMonitor
monitor = PerformanceMonitor()
metrics = monitor.analyze_performance(timeframe="1h")

# Automated deployment
from mlflow_assist.enterprise.deployment import DeploymentManager
deployer = DeploymentManager()
deployer.deploy(model, deployment_type="kubernetes")
```
