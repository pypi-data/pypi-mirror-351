## [0.2.0] - 2025-05-28

### üöÄ Major Features
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Automatic interface detection supporting both sync and async usage patterns
- **pytest-asyncio Integration**: Full compatibility with pytest-asyncio plugin when available
- **Dual Interface Support**: Works with `await async_benchmark(...)` (with pytest-asyncio) or `result = async_benchmark(...)` (without)
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects pytest-asyncio availability and provides appropriate interface

### ‚ú® Added
- Automatic pytest-asyncio detection and interface switching
- Legacy sync interface support for backwards compatibility with v0.1.x
- Optional dependency configuration for pytest-asyncio
- Comprehensive backwards compatibility test suite
- `_SyncResultWrapper` class for seamless sync interface
- Enhanced documentation covering both usage patterns

### üîß Changed
- **NON-BREAKING**: pytest-asyncio moved from required to optional dependency
- `AsyncBenchmarkFixture.__call__` now returns different types based on environment
- Enhanced fixture to support both sync and async interfaces automatically
- Updated examples to show both usage patterns
- README updated with backwards compatibility documentation

### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed
- RuntimeError issues when pytest-asyncio not available
- Event loop management conflicts in different environments
- Compatibility issues with projects not using pytest-asyncio

### üìö Documentation
