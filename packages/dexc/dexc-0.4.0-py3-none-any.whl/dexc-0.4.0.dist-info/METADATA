# dexc

Dexc is a Python exception formatter. It supports Python 3.11 and later.


## Features

- Context displayed in addition to the main line of each frame
- Truncated trace lines when there are too many
- Colorized stack trace obeying the the [NO_COLOR](https://no-color.org/) environment variable
- Minimization of frames when they are not part of the user code
- Support for Exception groups
- Highlighting of re-raises i.e. when an exception is caught and re-raised with more than a simple `raise`, causing two stack traces to be concatenated without separation
- Handling of [unraisable exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.unraisablehook) e.g. raised in a destructor
- Support for syntax errors
- Support for exception notes
- Support for warnings
- Collapse of repeated frames or groups of frames
- Disabling using the `DEXC_DISABLE=1` environment variable


## Caveats

Dexc should not be used in production code or to format untrusted exceptions. Because it relies on certain CPython-specific APIs, it may break on other runtimes or if your code displays exotic behavior, such as modifying `sys.modules` or updating source files while the program is running.

Furthermore, Dexc may produce incorrect output if your code or exception messages contain non-ASCII characters.


## Installation

$ pip install dexc
```


## Usage
