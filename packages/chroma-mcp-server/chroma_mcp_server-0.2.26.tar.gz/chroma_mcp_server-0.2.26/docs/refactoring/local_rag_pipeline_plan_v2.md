# ✅ Action Plan v2: Local RAG Pipeline (Hybrid Approach)

**Note:** This plan is outdated and has been replaced by [local_rag_pipeline_plan_v4.md](local_rag_pipeline_plan_v4.md).

**Goal:** Implement a local RAG pipeline using **direct ChromaDB access for automation (indexing, CI)** via installable client commands and the **`chroma-mcp-server` for interactive AI tasks (feedback, working memory)**, focusing on practicality, cost-efficiency, and quality improvement.

**Architecture:**

- **Automation (Git Hooks, CI, Scripts):** Use dedicated Python client modules (`src/chroma_mcp_client/`) exposed via installable console scripts (e.g., `chroma-client`) that connect *directly* to the ChromaDB backend based on `.env` config. Wrapper scripts (`scripts/`) can be used for internal repo tasks like git hooks.
- **Interaction (IDE - Cursor, Windsurf, etc.):** Use the `chroma-mcp-server` running via the IDE's MCP integration for feedback loops and sequential thinking tools. The thinking tools CLI (`record-thought`) now correctly uses stdio communication with the server.

**Important Development Workflow Notes:**

- **Rebuild & Reinstall after Changes:** After modifying the `chroma-mcp-server` codebase (including client or thinking modules), you **must** rebuild and reinstall the package within the Hatch environment to ensure the changes take effect when using `hatch run` commands (like the test script or the VS Code task). Use the following command from the project root:

  ```bash
  hatch build && hatch run pip uninstall chroma-mcp-server -y && hatch run pip install 'dist/chroma_mcp_server-<version>-py3-none-any.whl[full,dev]'
  ```

- **Run Tests After Updates:** After making code changes and reinstalling, always run the unit tests to ensure nothing is broken. Use the provided test script:

  ```bash
  ./scripts/test.sh -c -v
  ```

  This script handles coverage and verbose output automatically.

## Phase 1: Setup & Configuration (Common Components)

- [X] **1.1 Install Prerequisites:**
  - [X] Verify Python ≥ 3.10 (`python --version`)
  - [X] Verify Docker & Docker Compose (Needed *only* if running ChromaDB backend via HTTP/Docker, *not* required for persistent local DB or direct client usage) - *Consider removing Docker mentions if fully committed to non-Docker.*
  - [X] Verify Git (`git --version`)
  - [X] Install `chroma-mcp-server` (provides both server and reusable utils):
        ```bash
        # Installs server + core libs + embedding functions + client dependencies
        # Use the [client] extra for the command-line tools
        pip install "chroma-mcp-server[full,client]"
        ```
  - [X] Install any additional tools if needed (`jq`, `mkcert`, etc.).

- [X] **1.2 Prepare Shared Configuration (`.env`):**
  - [X] Create data/log directories (e.g., `./chroma_data`, `./logs`).
  - [X] Create `.env` in project root (used by *both* MCP server and direct client).
  - [X] **Cost Optimization:** Start with a local embedding function (`default`, `accurate`).
  - [X] **Security:** Add `.env` to `.gitignore`. Use secrets management for API keys/tokens in CI/shared environments.

  - [X] Create `src/chroma_mcp_client/` directory.

  - [X] Refactored and fixed tests for `chroma_mcp.cli` (`test_cli.py`) and `chroma_mcp_thinking.thinking_cli` (`tests/thinking/test_thinking_cli.py`).

- [X] **1.6 Create Wrapper Scripts (`scripts/*.sh` - for Internal Use):**
  - [X] Created shell script (`scripts/chroma_client.sh`).
  - [X] Created shell script (`scripts/thinking.sh`).
  - [X] Made scripts executable.
  - [X] **Note:** Updated note to reflect console scripts are primary interface.
  - [ ] **To be completed:** Create wrapper script for feedback if needed.

- [X] **1.7 Launch & Test MCP Server (for Interaction):**
  - [X] Run `chroma-mcp-server` normally (via IDE integration / `.cursor/mcp.json`).
  - [X] Verify connection via MCP client (e.g., Cursor Tool window).
  - [X] Verified server starts correctly via `python -m chroma_mcp.cli` (used by `record-thought`).

- [X] **1.8 Verify Direct Client Connection (HTTP/Cloud via Console Script):**
  - [X] Use the console script to test connection to remote backends.
  - [X] Ensure no connection errors are reported (check stderr).

- [X] **1.9 Security & Secrets Checklist:**
  - [X] Ensure `.env` is git-ignored.
  - [X] Use secrets management for API keys/tokens in CI/shared environments.
  - [X] Store `CHROMA_API_KEY` / header tokens securely, inject at runtime.

- [X] **1.10 Add Unit Tests for Client Logic (`tests/client/`, etc.):**
  - [X] Create `tests/client/`, `tests/feedback/`, `tests/thinking/` directories.
  - [X] Implement unit tests using `pytest`.
  - [X] Mock `chromadb` and `mcp.ClientSession` interactions.
  - [X] Test argument parsing, file handling, ID generation, JSON output.
  - [X] Aim for >= 80% code coverage. (Current: ~78%)
  - [X] Run tests: `hatch run test` (All tests passing).
  - [X] **Remember:** Run `./scripts/test.sh -c -v` after code changes to verify tests pass.

- [X] **1.11 Document Client Usage (`docs/usage/client_commands.md`):**
