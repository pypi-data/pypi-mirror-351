# ✅ Action Plan v3: Local RAG Pipeline (Implicit Learning via Chat History)

**Note:** This plan is outdated and has been replaced by [local_rag_pipeline_plan_v4.md](local_rag_pipeline_plan_v4.md).

**Goal:** Implement a local RAG pipeline using **direct ChromaDB access for automation (indexing, CI)** via installable client commands and the **`chroma-mcp-server` for interactive AI tasks (working memory, automated chat logging)**, focusing on deriving implicit learning by correlating summarized chat interactions with code changes.

**Architecture:**

- **Automation (Git Hooks, CI, Scripts):** Use dedicated Python client modules (`src/chroma_mcp_client/`) exposed via installable console scripts (e.g., `chroma-client`) that connect *directly* to the ChromaDB backend based on `.env` config. Wrapper scripts (`scripts/`) can be used for internal repo tasks like git hooks.
- **Interaction (IDE - Cursor, Windsurf, etc.):** Use the `chroma-mcp-server` running via the IDE's MCP integration. The server facilitates working memory tools and, critically, enables the AI assistant to **automatically log summarized prompt/response pairs** to a dedicated `chat_history` collection via MCP calls.
- **Learning Extraction:** A separate analysis process correlates the summarized interactions in `chat_history` with actual code changes found in `codebase_v1` (or Git history) to identify implemented suggestions and extract validated learnings.

**Important Development Workflow Notes:**

- **Rebuild & Reinstall after Changes:** After modifying the `chroma-mcp-server` codebase (including client or thinking modules), you **must** rebuild and reinstall the package within the Hatch environment to ensure the changes take effect when using `hatch run` commands (like the test script or the VS Code task). Use the following command from the project root:

  ```bash
  hatch build && hatch run pip uninstall chroma-mcp-server -y && hatch run pip install 'dist/chroma_mcp_server-<version>-py3-none-any.whl[full,dev]'
  ```

- **Run Tests After Updates:** After making code changes and reinstalling, always run the unit tests to ensure nothing is broken. Use the provided test script:

  ```bash
  ./scripts/test.sh -c -v
  ```

  This script handles coverage and verbose output automatically.

## Phase 1: Setup & Configuration (Common Components)

- [X] **1.1 Install Prerequisites:**
  - [X] Verify Python ≥ 3.10 (`python --version`)
  - [X] Verify Docker & Docker Compose (Needed *only* if running ChromaDB backend via HTTP/Docker, *not* required for persistent local DB or direct client usage) - *Consider removing Docker mentions if fully committed to non-Docker.*
  - [X] Verify Git (`git --version`)
  - [X] Install `chroma-mcp-server` (provides both server and reusable utils):
        ```bash
        # Installs server + core libs + embedding functions + client dependencies
        # Use the [client] extra for the command-line tools
        pip install "chroma-mcp-server[full,client]"
        ```
  - [X] Install any additional tools if needed (`jq`, `mkcert`, etc.).

- [X] **1.2 Prepare Shared Configuration (`.env`):**
  - [X] Create data/log directories (e.g., `./chroma_data`, `./logs`).
  - [X] Create `.env` in project root (used by *both* MCP server and direct client).
  - [X] **Cost Optimization:** Start with a local embedding function (`default`, `accurate`).

---

## Phase 4: Implicit Learning via Chat History Analysis (via MCP & Analysis Script)

*This phase replaces explicit feedback with automated capture and analysis.*

- [~] **4.1 Define Chat History Collection (e.g., `chat_history_v1`):**
  - [X] Use MCP client (`mcp_chroma_dev_chroma_create_collection`) to create it.
  - [ ] Define required metadata structure (when adding documents to the collection):
    - `session_id`: Identifier for the interaction session.
    - `timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp of the interaction.
    - `prompt_summary`: Concise summary of the user's request (the "Why").
    - `response_summary`: Concise summary of the AI's response/suggestion (the "How").
    - `involved_entities`: List of key files, functions, concepts mentioned (the "What").
    - `status`: e.g., `captured`, `analyzed`, `learning_extracted`.
    - (Optional) `raw_prompt_hash`, `raw_response_hash`: Hashes for linking to potential raw logs.

- [X] **4.2 Implement Automated Chat Capture & Summarization:**
  - [X] **Mechanism:** Define an IDE rule (e.g., `.cursor/rules/auto_log_chat.mdc` and copy in `docs/rules/auto_log_chat.md` for other IDEs) instructing the AI assistant to:
    1. After generating a response, summarize the preceding prompt and the generated response, focusing on the "Why, How, What".
    2. Call an MCP tool (e.g., `mcp_chroma_dev_chroma_add_document_with_metadata`) to store these summaries and associated metadata in the `chat_history_v1` collection.
    - [X] Ensure the `.cursor/rules/auto_log_chat.mdc` file starts with the following enclosed lines within the markdown block before the rule definition:

        ```markdown
        ---
        description: This rule helps to log chat history to the `chat_history_v1` collection
        globs:
        alwaysApply: true
        ---
        ```

    See [Automated Chat History Logging](docs/integration/automated_chat_logging.md) for details on setting up this rule.

  - [X] **Feasibility Confirmed:** ~~Investigate the reliability of enforcing such actions via IDE rules. Develop fallback or complementary mechanisms if needed.~~ **Confirmed:** Initial tests show the mechanism of using an IDE rule to trigger automated logging via MCP calls is feasible. **Note:** Continued monitoring for reliability across diverse interactions is recommended, as rule refinements were needed during initial testing.

- [X] **4.3 Develop Analysis Engine (e.g., script wrapper in `../../scripts/analyze_chat_history.sh` and CLI subcommand in `src/chroma_mcp_client/cli.py` as well as pyproject.toml [project.scripts] entry):**
  - [X] Included a `analyze-chat-history` subcommand that:
    1. Fetches recent entries from `chat_history_v1` (e.g., status=`captured`).
    2. For each entry, identifies the `involved_entities` (files).
    3. Retrieves corresponding file versions/diffs from `codebase_v1` or Git history occurring *after* the chat timestamp.
    4. Compares the `response_summary` (How) with the actual code changes (What) to determine if the suggestion was implemented (correlation).
    5. Updates the status of analyzed chat entries (e.g., to `analyzed`).
  - [X] **Resolved:** Addressed significant challenges including embedding function mismatches by updating collection metadata and adjusting client usage, alongside extensive test debugging.

- [ ] **4.4 Define Learning Extraction and Storage:**
  - [ ] **Extraction:** Based on correlated entries, extract structured learnings (e.g., "Applying pattern X to file Y solved problem Z described in prompt P").
  - [ ] **Storage:** Store these validated learnings in a dedicated collection (e.g., `derived_learnings_v1`) or enrich an existing one like `dev_learnings`. Define the schema for these learning entries.
  - [ ] Update the status of chat entries where learnings were extracted (e.g., to `learning_extracted`).

- [ ] **4.5 Integrate Analysis into Workflow:**
  - [ ] Determine trigger mechanism: Manual execution of the analysis script, scheduled job (e.g., nightly), or a Git hook (e.g., post-merge on the main branch). Start with manual execution.

- [ ] **4.6 Refine Interactive Retrieval using Derived Learnings:**
  - [ ] Modify prompts/rules for interactive RAG (`chroma_query_documents`) to also query the `derived_learnings_v1` collection, potentially giving higher weight to these validated insights.

- [ ] **4.7 Document Implicit Learning Mechanism (`../usage/implicit_learning.md`):**
  - [ ] Explain the automated capture, summarization, analysis, and learning extraction process.
  - [ ] Document the `chat_history_v1` and `derived_learnings_v1` schemas.
  - [ ] Provide examples of how to run the analysis script.
  - [ ] Explain how derived learnings improve future RAG results.

## Phase 5: Working Memory & Sequential Thinking (via MCP)

---

**Outcome:** A functional local RAG pipeline using a **hybrid architecture**: direct client access (via installable console commands) for robust automation (indexing), and the `chroma-mcp-server` for interactive AI tasks (working memory) and **automated capture of summarized chat interactions**. An analysis engine correlates chat history with code changes to **implicitly derive validated learnings**, improving the system over time without requiring explicit user feedback.
