class Rules:
    """Loader for transaction‐sorting rule matchers defined in YAML files.

    This class locates rule definitions under a base directory structured by
    top‐level categories (`revenue`, `cost_of_revenue`, `expenses`, `other_income`,
    `other_expense`, `ignore`). Within each category, it searches for YAML files
    named `match_on_hash.{yml,yaml}`, `match_on_from_address.{yml,yaml}`, and
    `match_on_to_address.{yml,yaml}`. Each file may define mapping of transaction
    identifiers to subgroup names under the current chain ID, and those mappings
    are used to create corresponding matcher instances.

    Upon initialization, all matchers are built exactly once, and each matcher
    registers itself in the global in‐memory registry so that incoming transactions
    can be routed accordingly.

    Examples:
        >>> from pathlib import Path
        >>> from dao_treasury.sorting._rules import Rules
        >>> rules = Rules(Path("config/sorting_rules"))
        # Given a file config/sorting_rules/revenue/match_on_hash.yml containing:
        #  1:
        #    DonationReceived:
        #      - 0xabc123...
        #
        # The above will create a `TxGroup` named "Revenue:DonationReceived"
        # and a `HashMatcher` that routes tx hash "0xabc123..." to it.
