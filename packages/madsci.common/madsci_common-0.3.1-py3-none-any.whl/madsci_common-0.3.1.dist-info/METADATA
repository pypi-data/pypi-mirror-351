# MADSci Common

Common types, validators, serializers, utilities, and other flotsam and jetsam used across the MADSci toolkit.

## Installation

The MADSci common components are available via [the Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/madsci.common/), and can be installed via:

```bash
pip install madsci.common
```

This python package is also included as part of the [madsci Docker image](https://github.com/orgs/AD-SDL/packages/container/package/madsci).

## MADSci Types

The MADSci toolkit uses a variety of "types", implemented as [Pydantic Data Models](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/). These data models allow us to easily create, validate, serialize, and de-serialize data structures used throughout the distributed systems. They can easily be serialized to JSON when being sent between system components over REST or stored in JSON-friendly databases like MongoDB or Redis, or to YAML for human-readable and editable definition files.

You can import these types from `madsci.common.types`, where they are organized by subsystem.
