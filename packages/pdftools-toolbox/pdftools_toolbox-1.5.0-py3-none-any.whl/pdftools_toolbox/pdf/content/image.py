        Extract embedded image from PDF

         
        Facilitate the extraction of images from a specified page within a PDF, outputting them in the `imageType` format.
         
        By default, the method determines the format of the extracted image based on the embedded image data present within the PDF. 
        Users can ascertain the default image format through `pdftools_toolbox.pdf.content.image.Image.default_image_type`. 
        It's important to note that not all image types or conversion processes are universally supported, hence adhering to the default `pdftools_toolbox.pdf.content.image_type.ImageType` is advisable for optimal compatibility.
         
        Key considerations include:
            - The extraction process isolates the image from the page's resources, neglecting any contextual attributes from the PDF page. Consequently, the original resolution and modifications—such as scaling, rotation, or cropping—that influence the image's appearance on the page are not preserved in the extracted image.
            - In instances where a `pdftools_toolbox.generic_error.GenericError` error arises, the output file may be compromised and rendered unusable.
         
        This method is designed to efficiently retrieve images without their page-specific modifications, ensuring a straightforward extraction process.

            stream (io.IOBase):

                The desired image type of the extracted image stream.
                If the embedded image data cannot be directly extracted to the chosen ImageType, the data is first recompressed and then extracted to the chosen ImageType.
                In this case, extraction is slower and there can be some loss of image quality.
                The default image type can be retrieved by calling `pdftools_toolbox.pdf.content.image.Image.default_image_type`.
