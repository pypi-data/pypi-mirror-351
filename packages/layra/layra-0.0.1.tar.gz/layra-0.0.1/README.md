# Layra
> Modern Python project boilerplate generator with intelligent defaults.

Layra eliminates the repitive setup process for new Python projects by providing modern,
opinionated boilerplates with best practices built-in.
Stop wasting time configuring the same tools over and over
— focus on building amazing software instead.

## ✨ Why Layra?
**The problem:** Every new Python project requires the same tedious setup:

- Configuring linters and formatters (ruff, black, mypy)
- Setting up pre-commit hooks
- Creating proper project structure
- Writing CI/CD pipelines
- Configuring testing frameworks
- Managing dependencies and virtual environments

**Layra's approach**:

- 🚀 **Interactive CLI** with smart prompts and sensible defaults
- 🛠️ **Modern tooling** built-in (ruff, uv, pytest, GitHub Actions)
- 📋 **Multiple profiles** for different project types
- 🔄 **Future-ready** with planned update and customization features

## 🚀 Quick Start
### Installation

```bash
pip install layra
```

### Create your first project

```bash
# Configure Layra
layra setup

# Create a web API project
layra new my-api --profile web-fastapi
```

## 🗺️ Roadmap
### 🔄 Coming Soon

- **Project Updates**: Update existing projects with new boilerplate versions
- **Custom Profiles**: Create and share your own project templates  
- **Service Integrations**: Pre-configured setups for popular services
- **Configuration Management**: Customize default settings and preferences
