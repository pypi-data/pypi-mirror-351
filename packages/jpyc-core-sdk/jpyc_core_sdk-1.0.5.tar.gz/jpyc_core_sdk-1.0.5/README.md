# Core SDK

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](./LICENSE)
![build](https://github.com/jcam1/python-sdk/actions/workflows/check.yml/badge.svg)

A Python SDK to interact with [the JPYCv2's core contracts](https://github.com/jcam1/JPYCv2/blob/main/contracts/v1/FiatTokenV1.sol). Ideal for those who want to interact with JPYC protocol in any Python-backend environments.

## ü™Ñ Usage

### 1. Install `jpyc-core-sdk` Package

```sh
# uv
$ uv add jpyc-core-sdk
# poetry
$ poetry add jpyc-core-sdk
# pip
$ pip install jpyc-core-sdk
```

### 2. Configure SDK Clients

```py
from jpyc_core_sdk import JPYC, SdkClient

# Configure SDK client using default RPC endpoint
client = SdkClient(
    chain_name="ethereum",
    network_name="mainnet",
    private_key={PRIVATE_KEY},
)

# Or configure SDK client using custom RPC endpoint
client = SdkClient(
    chain_name="ethereum",
    network_name="mainnet",
    private_key={PRIVATE_KEY},
    rpc_endpoint={CUSTOM_RPC_ENDPOINT},
)

# Configure JPYC client
jpyc = JPYC(client=client)
```

> [!TIP]
> As for sensitive data such as private keys or api keys, we strongly recommend using some secure storage and read them from the securely embedded environment variables. This reflects our design decision of not using any environment variables within the SDK itself, aiming to make it as flexible as possible for the developers. Also, using some arbitrary environmental variables often results in unexpected behaviors (e.g., naming conflicts).

### 3. Call JPYC Contracts

Use the configured JPYC client to call JPYC's contract functions wherever you would like.

```py
from {CONFIG_FILE} import jpyc

...
# Call a contract function (e.g., transfer)
tx_hash = jpyc.transfer(
    to={TO_ADDRESS},
    value=2025,
)
...
```

> [!NOTE]

> - More code examples are available at [`examples` directory](./examples/).
> - More detailed development documentation is available at [`docs` directory](../../docs/core/).

## ‚õìÔ∏è Supported Networks

Please use one of the combinations of chain-network names when configuring the SDK clients.

> [!TIP]
> For local testing & development, you could use `localhost`-`devnet` pair.

|  Chain Name | Network Names        |
| ----------: | :------------------- |
|  `ethereum` | `mainnet`, `sepolia` |
|   `polygon` | `mainnet`, `amoy`    |
|    `gnosis` | `mainnet`, `chiado`  |
| `avalanche` | `mainnet`, `fuji`    |
|     `astar` | `mainnet`            |
|    `shiden` | `mainnet`            |
| `localhost` | `devnet`             |

## üí¨ Supported Providers

**We're currently supporting `HTTPProvider` (the most simple & widely-used one) only.** More providers (notably `WebSocketProvider`) are to be supported in the near future, so stay tuned!

## üõ† Development

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Sections below are mainly for the advanced users (e.g., contributors of this repo).

### üì¶ Package Management

#### Add packages

```sh
# add packages for production
$ uv add {package_name}
# add packages for development
$ uv add --dev {package_name}
```

#### Remove packages

```sh
# remove production packages
$ uv remove {package_name}
# remove development packages
$ uv remove --dev {package_name}
```

### üîé Testing

Please see [`README` at `tests` directory](../../tests/README.md).

### ‚úÖ Static Code Analysis

> [!NOTE]
> Analysis results are also to be checked on our [CI workflow](../../.github/workflows/check.yml).

#### Linting

```sh
# run linter without fixing
$ uv run ruff check {dir_name}
# run linter & auto-fix (if available)
$ uv run ruff check {dir_name} --fix
```

#### Formatting

```sh
# run formatter without fixing
$ uv run ruff format {dir_name} --check
# run formatter & auto-fix
$ uv run ruff format {dir_name}
```

#### Type Checking

```sh
# run mypy
$ uv run mypy {dir_name}
```

#### Pre-Commit Hooks

Pre-commit script is configured at [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](../../.pre-commit-config.yaml). This automatically runs the configured hooks before executing any `git commit` commands. You could also simulate the hooks by running the following.

```sh
# simulate pre-commit hooks without creating an actual commit
$ uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```
