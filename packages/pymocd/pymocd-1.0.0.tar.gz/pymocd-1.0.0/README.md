## Overview  
**pymocd** is a Rust-powered Python library designed for efficient multi-objective evolutionary algorithms in community detection. It enhances performance over traditional methods, making it ideal for large-scale graph analysis. This project continues from [re-mocd](https://github.com/0l1ve1r4/re-mocd). Visit the [Docs](https://oliveira-sh.github.io/pymocd/) to help and usage.

## Features  
- High-performance Rust backend;  
- Multi-objective optimization;  
- Scalable to large graphs  
- Easy-to-use Python API
