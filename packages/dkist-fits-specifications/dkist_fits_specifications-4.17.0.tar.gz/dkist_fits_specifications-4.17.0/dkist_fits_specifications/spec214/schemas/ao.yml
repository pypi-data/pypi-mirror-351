  description: "Value of Fried's parameter at start of data acquisition."
  units: m
AO_LOCK:
  rename: "AO___002"
  description: "Lock status of HOAO during data acquisition.
                false: HOAO was unlocked for some duration of data acquisition
                true: HOAO was locked for the complete duration of data acquisition"
  units: null

LIMBRPOS:
  rename: "AO___007"
  description: "Radial set position with respect to the limb as seen at the sensing wavelength of the Limb Sensor
                = 0 indicates occulting at the limb
                > 0 indicates over-occulting, i.e. the limb is not visible
                < 0 indicates under-occulting i.e. the limb is visible"
  units: arcsec
LIMBRATE:

  description: "Frequency with which the Limb Sensor position is read out"
  units: Hz
