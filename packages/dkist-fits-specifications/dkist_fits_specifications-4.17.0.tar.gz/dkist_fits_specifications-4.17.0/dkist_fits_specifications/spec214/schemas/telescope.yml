CRPIX<n>:
  description: "The value field shall contain a floating point number, identifying the location of a reference point along axis n of the Helioprojective coordinate system, in units of the axis index. This value is based upon a counter that runs from 1 to NAXISn with an increment of 1 per pixel. The reference point value need not be that for the center of a pixel nor lie within the actual data array. Use comments to indicate the location of the index point relative to the pixel. DKIST pointing data will be relative to the boresight of the telescope defined by the WFC Context Viewer that will center an image of the GOS pinhole on its detector using a 10 nm wavelength band centered on 525 nm. The same pinhole image will be used by all instruments as reference for determining the pointing of the instrument in relation to the WFC Context Viewer."
