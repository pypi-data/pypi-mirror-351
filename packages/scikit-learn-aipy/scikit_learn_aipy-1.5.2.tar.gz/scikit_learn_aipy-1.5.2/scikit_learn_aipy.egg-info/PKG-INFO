This project is a branch of [scikit-learn](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/) on [QPython](https://www.qpython.org).

scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

The project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer of Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed. See the [About us](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/about.html#authors) page for a list of core contributors.

It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers.
