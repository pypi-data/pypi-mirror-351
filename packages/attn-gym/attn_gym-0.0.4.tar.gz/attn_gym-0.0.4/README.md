## 🎯 Features

- Implementations of various attention mechanisms using FlexAttention
- Utility functions for creating and combining attention masks
- Examples of how to use FlexAttention in real-world scenarios

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- PyTorch (version 2.5 or higher)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pytorch-labs/attention-gym.git
cd attention-gym
pip install .
```

## 💻 Usage

There are two main ways to use Attention Gym:

1. **Run Example Scripts**: Many files in the project can be executed directly to demonstrate their functionality:
   ```bash
   python attn_gym/masks/document_mask.py
   ```
   These scripts often generate visualizations to help you understand the attention mechanisms.

2. **Import in Your Projects**: You can use Attention Gym components in your own work by importing them:
   ```python
   from torch.nn.attention.flex_attention import flex_attention, create_block_mask
   from attn_gym.masks import generate_sliding_window

   # Use the imported function in your code
   sliding_window_mask_mod = generate_sliding_window(window_size=1024)
   block_mask = create_block_mask(sliding_window_mask_mod, 1, 1, S, S, device=device)
   out = flex_attention(query, key, value, block_mask=block_mask)
   ```

For comprehensive examples of using FlexAttention in real-world scenarios, explore the `examples/` directory. These end-to-end implementations showcase how to integrate various attention mechanisms into your models.

### Note

Attention Gym is under active development, and we do not currently offer any backward compatibility guarantees. APIs and functionalities may change between versions. We recommend pinning to a specific version in your projects and carefully reviewing changes when upgrading.

## 📁 Structure

Attention Gym is organized for easy exploration of attention mechanisms:

```

## 🤝 Contributing
We welcome contributions to Attention Gym, especially new Masks or score mods! Here's how you can contribute:

### Contributing Mods

1. Create a new file in the [attn_gym/masks/](attn_gym/masks) for mask_mods or [attn_gym/mods/](attn_gym/mods) for score_mods.
2. Implement your function, and add a simple main function that showcases your new function.
3. Update the `attn_gym/*/__init__.py` file to include your new function.
5. [Optinally] Add an end to end example using your new func in the [examples/](examples/) directory.
