        Train n_estimators independent trees.
        You may want to evaluate datasets while training. If so, please do the following things:
            1. set `verbosity` = 1 to print the evaluation
            2. set a proper `sequential_batch`, for 1 or 4 depending on cores of your CPU
            3. set the `evalset` to a dict of tuples of your dataset that is going to be evaluated
            4. set the `evalmetrics` either to a string of metrics or a list of strings
        You may want the algorithm to decide to stop training automatically. If so, please do things above, plus:
            1. set `early_stop` to a number of batches, like 1 or 2, which acts like: 
                if the metrics for all/some/any/most of the evaluation sets do not decrease anymore, 
                the training process will be terminated and return
            2. set `early_stop_logic` to determine the way of processing non-decreasing datasets/metrics
            3. If you hope to continue to train again, call this `fit` again with `continue_to_train` set to True

        Parameters:
            ----------
            X: Matrix | Tensor, the feature matrix (each row is a sample).
            y: Matrix | Tensor, the target values (for regression, numerical; for classification, one-hot or multi-label).
            Optional:
                one_hot : bool, if y is one-hot encoded for classification tasks.
                verbosity: int | None, if >= 1 and having `evalset`, then will report metrics each batch.
                sequential_batch: int | None, if int, then train `batch` estimators as a batch before evaluating.
                evalset: Dict[name : Tuple[X, y],
                              ...], | None, if provided, it may be used as evaluation set. XGBoost style.
                evalmetrics: list of str | str | None, metrics used to do the evaluation. Will be printed.
                early_stop: int | None, if non-None, then if metrics NOT gained for `early_stop` times, the forest will stop training.
                early_stop_logic: str, the logic when deciding on multiple metrics, can be {"any", "some", "most", "all"}.
                continue_to_train: bool | None, if non-None and True, the machine will try to restore the place it was and continue
                                   to train new estimators until a new stopping criterion meets or until reaches the max number of allowed estimators.
