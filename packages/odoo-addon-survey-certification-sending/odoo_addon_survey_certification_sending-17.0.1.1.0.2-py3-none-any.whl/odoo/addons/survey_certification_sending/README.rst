Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to Survey > Surveys.
2. Create or edit a certification survey.
3. Configure whether you want to send certifications manually by
   checking the "Skip Auto Email" option.
4. Participants who pass the survey will receive their certification
   automatically if manual submission is not enabled.
5. If the automatic sending is disabled, passed certifications can be
   submitted manually from the "Send certification email" action.
6. Certifications that have already been sent will be marked as
   "Certification sent".
7. Passed certifications can be sent as many times as necessary.
