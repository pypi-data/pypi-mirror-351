`toml-combine` is a Python lib and CLI-tool that reads a TOML configuration file
defining a default configuration alongside with overrides, and merges everything
following rules you define to get final configurations. Let's say: you have multiple
services, and environments, and you want to describe them all without repeating the
parts that are common to everyone.

## Concepts

### The config file

The configuration file is (usually) a TOML file. Here's a small example:

```toml
[dimensions]
environment = ["production", "staging"]

[default]
name = "my-service"
registry = "gcr.io/my-project/"
container.image_name = "my-image"
container.port = 8080

[[override]]
when.environment = "production"
service_account = "my-production-service-account"

[[override]]
when.environment = "staging"
service_account = "my-staging-service-account"
```

### Dimensions

Consider all the configurations you want to generate. Each one differs from the others.
Dimensions lets you describe the main "thing" that makes the outputs differents, e.g.:
`environment` might be `staging` or `production`, region might be `eu` or `us`, and
service might be `frontend` or `backend`. Some combinations of dimensions might not
exists, for example, maybe there's no `staging` in `eu`.

### Default

The common configuration to start from, before we start overlaying overrides on top.

### Overrides

Each override defines a set of condition where it applies (`when.<dimension> =
"<dimension_value>"`) and a set of overridden key/values.

```toml
[[override]]
# Keys starting with `when.` are "conditions"
when.environment = "staging"
when.region = "us"

# Other keys in an override are "overridden keys" / "overridden values"
service_account = "my-us-staging-service-account"
```

If you run `toml-combine` with a given mapping that selects multiple overrides, they
will be checked for _compatibility_ with one another, and an error will be raised if
they're _not compatible_.

Compatibility rules:

- If the two overrides don't share any _overridden key_, then they're always compatible.

  ```toml
  [dimensions]
  environment = ["staging"]
  region = ["eu"]

  [[override]]
  when.environment = "staging"
  service_account = "my-staging-service-account"

  [[override]]
  when.region = "eu"
  env.CURRENCY = "EUR"
  ```

  </details>

- If an override defines a set of conditions (say `env=prod`) and the other one defines
  strictly more conditions (say `env=prod, region=eu`, in other words, it defines all
  the conditions of the first override and then some more), then they're compatible.
  Also, in that case, **the override with more conditions will have precedence**.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```toml
  [dimensions]
  environment = ["staging"]
  region = ["eu"]

  [[override]]
  when.environment = "staging"
  service_account = "my-staging-service-account"

  [[override]]
  when.environment = "staging"
  when.region = "eu"
  service_account = "my-staging-eu-service-account"
  ```

  </details>

- If they both define a dimension that the other one doesn't, they're incompatible.

  <details>
  <summary>Example (click to expand)</summary>

  Incompatible overrides: neither is a subset of the other one and they both
  define a value for `service_account`:

  ```toml
  [dimensions]
  environment = ["staging"]
  region = ["eu"]

  [default]
  service_account = "my-service-account"

  [[override]]
  when.environment = "staging"
  service_account = "my-staging-service-account"

  [[override]]
  when.region = "eu"
  service_account = "my-eu-service-account"
  ```

  ```console
  $ toml-combine config.toml --environment=staging --region=eu
  Error: Incompatible overrides `{'region': ['eu']}` and `{'environment': ['staging']}`:
  When they're both applicable, overrides defining a common overridden key (foo) must be
  a subset of one another
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > It's ok to have incompatible overrides in your config as long as you don't
  > run `toml-combine` with a mapping that would select both of them. In the example
  > above, if you run `toml-combine --environment=staging --region=eu`, the error
  > will be triggered, but you can run `toml-combine --environment=staging`.

  </details>

> [!NOTE]
> Instead of defining a single value for the override dimensions, you can define a list.
> This is a shortcut to duplicating the override with each individual value:
>
> ```
> [[override]]
> when.environment = ["staging", "prod"]
> service_account = "my-service-account"
> ```

### The configuration itself

Under the layer of `dimensions/default/override/mapping` system, what you actually
define in the configuration is completely up to you. That said, only nested
"dictionnaries"/"objects"/"tables"/"mapping" (those are all the same things in
Python/JS/Toml lingo) will be merged between the default and the applicable overrides,
while arrays will just replace one another. See `Arrays` below.

### Arrays

Let's look at an example:

```toml
[dimensions]
environment = ["production", "staging"]

[default]
fruits = [{name="apple", color="red"}]

[[override]]
when.environment = "staging"
fruits = [{name="orange", color="orange"}]
```

In this example, with `{"environment": "staging"}`, `fruits` is
`[{name="orange", color="orange"}]` and not
`[{name="apple", color="red"}, {name="orange", color="orange"}]`.
The only way to get multiple values to be merged is if they are dicts: you'll need
to chose an element to become the key:

```toml
[dimensions]
environment = ["production", "staging"]

[default]
fruits.apple.color = "red"

[[override]]
when.environment = "staging"
fruits.orange.color = "orange"
```

In this example, on staging, `fruits` is `{apple={color="red"}, orange={color="orange"}}`.

This example is simple because `name` is a natural choice for the key. In some cases,
the choice is less natural, but you can always decide to name the elements of your
list and use that name as a key. Also, yes, you'll loose ordering.

### Mapping

When you call the tool either with the CLI or the lib (see both below), you will have to
provide a mapping of the desired dimentions. These values will be compared to overrides
to apply overrides when relevant. It's ok to omit some dimensions, corresponding
overrides won't be selected.

By default, the output is `toml` though you can switch to `json` with `--format=json`

## CLI

Example with the config from the previous section:

```console
$ toml-combine path/to/config.toml --environment=staging
```

```toml
[fruits]
apple.color = "red"
orange.color = "orange"
```

## Lib

```python
import toml_combine


result = toml_combine.combine(config_file=config_file, environment="staging")

print(result)
{
  "fruits": {"apple": {"color": "red"}, "orange": {"color": "orange"}}
}
```

You can pass either `config` (TOML string or dict) or `config_file` (`pathlib.Path` or string path) to `combine()`. All other `kwargs` specify the mapping you want.

## A bigger example

```toml
[dimensions]
environment = ["production", "staging", "dev"]
service = ["frontend", "backend"]

[default]
registry = "gcr.io/my-project/"
service_account = "my-service-account"

[[override]]
when.service = "frontend"
name = "service-frontend"
container.image_name = "my-image-frontend"

[[override]]
when.service = "backend"
name = "service-backend"
container.image_name = "my-image-backend"
container.port = 8080

[[override]]
when.service = "backend"
when.environment = "dev"
name = "service-dev"
container.env.DEBUG = true

[[override]]
when.environment = ["staging", "dev"]
when.service = "backend"
container.env.ENABLE_EXPENSIVE_MONITORING = false
```

This produces the following configs:

```console
$ toml-combine example.toml --environment=production --service=frontend
```

```toml
registry = "gcr.io/my-project/"
service_account = "my-service-account"
name = "service-frontend"

[container]
image_name = "my-image-frontend"
```

```console
$ toml-combine example.toml --environment=production --service=backend
```

```toml
registry = "gcr.io/my-project/"
service_account = "my-service-account"
name = "service-backend"

[container]
image_name = "my-image-backend"
port = 8080
```

```console
$ toml-combine example.toml --environment=staging --service=frontend
```

```toml
registry = "gcr.io/my-project/"
service_account = "my-service-account"
name = "service-frontend"

[container]
image_name = "my-image-frontend"
```

```console
$ toml-combine example.toml --environment=staging --service=backend
```

```toml
registry = "gcr.io/my-project/"
service_account = "my-service-account"
name = "service-backend"

[container]
image_name = "my-image-backend"
port = 8080

[container.env]
ENABLE_EXPENSIVE_MONITORING = false
```

```console
$ toml-combine example.toml --environment=dev --service=backend
```

```toml
registry = "gcr.io/my-project/"
service_account = "my-service-account"
name = "service-backend"

[container]
image_name = "my-image-backend"
port = 8080
[container.env]
DEBUG = true
ENABLE_EXPENSIVE_MONITORING = false
```
