# Major Errors in the EcoCycle Codebase

This document outlines significant issues identified in the EcoCycle codebase that should be addressed to improve code quality, security, and maintainability.

## Architectural Issues

[ ] Circular Dependencies**: Multiple instances of circular imports between modules (e.g., main.py, dependency_manager.py, user_manager.py).
[ ] Monolithic Files**: Several files are excessively large (e.g., database_manager.py with 1763 lines) and should be split into smaller, more focused modules.
[ ] Inconsistent MVC Pattern**: The codebase attempts to follow MVC but has inconsistent separation of concerns with business logic sometimes appearing in views.

## Security Vulnerabilities

[ ] Hardcoded Credentials**: Admin credentials are hardcoded in user_manager.py's main block (lines 1031-1057).
[ ] Insecure Session Management**: Session secret key handling has issues, with inadequate fallback when the key is missing.
[ ] API Key Exposure**: API keys are directly embedded in code or read from environment variables without proper validation.
[ ] OAuth Implementation Issues**: The Google OAuth implementation has potential security issues in the redirect URL handling.
[ ] Insufficient Input Validation**: Some user inputs are not properly validated before being used in database queries.

## Error Handling

[ ] Inconsistent Error Handling**: Different approaches to error handling across the codebase (sometimes returning None, sometimes empty objects, sometimes raising exceptions).
[ ] Silent Failures**: Many functions catch exceptions and log them but don't properly communicate failures to calling code.
[ ] Missing Error Recovery**: Limited mechanisms for recovering from errors, especially in critical paths like authentication.
[ ] Overly Broad Exception Handling**: Many `except Exception` blocks that catch all exceptions without specific handling for different error types.

## Performance Issues

[ ] Inefficient Database Operations**: No connection pooling or prepared statements for frequently executed queries.
[ ] Redundant API Calls**: Weather API is called multiple times without proper caching strategies.
[ ] Large Memory Footprint**: Loading entire datasets into memory without pagination or streaming.
[ ] Missing Indexes**: Database tables lack proper indexes for frequently queried columns.

## Code Quality Issues

[ ] Duplicate Code**: Significant code duplication across modules, especially in validation and error handling logic.
[ ] Inconsistent Naming Conventions**: Mixed naming styles (camelCase, snake_case) within the same modules.
[ ] Outdated Python Practices**: Using older Python idioms instead of more modern approaches.
[ ] Missing Type Hints**: Inconsistent use of type hints across the codebase.
[ ] Inadequate Documentation**: Many functions lack proper docstrings or have outdated documentation.

## Configuration Management

[ ] Hardcoded Configuration**: Many configuration values are hardcoded rather than being in a central configuration system.
[ ] Environment Variable Handling**: Inconsistent approach to reading and validating environment variables.
[ ] Missing Default Configurations**: Some modules fail when configuration is missing rather than using sensible defaults.
[ ] No Configuration Validation**: No validation of configuration values at startup.

## Testing Issues

[ ] Insufficient Test Coverage**: Many critical components lack comprehensive tests.
[ ] No Integration Tests**: Focus on unit tests without proper integration testing.
[ ] No Mocking Strategy**: Inconsistent approach to mocking external dependencies in tests.
[ ] No Test for Error Conditions**: Tests focus on happy paths without testing error conditions.

## Dependency Management

[ ] Inconsistent Dependency Handling**: Some modules try to import optional dependencies directly, others use dependency_manager.
[ ] Missing Version Pinning**: Dependencies aren't properly version-pinned, risking compatibility issues.
[ ] No Dependency Isolation**: No virtual environment or container configuration provided.
[ ] Manual Dependency Installation**: Users must manually install dependencies rather than using a proper package manager.
