## Features and Functionality

### How accurate is the environmental impact calculation?
Our calculations are based on scientific research comparing cycling emissions to average car emissions, taking into account your specific routes, distances, and local factors. While not exact to the gram, they provide a meaningful representation of your positive environmental impact.

### Can I import data from other cycling apps?
Yes, EcoCycle supports importing data from several popular platforms including Strava, Garmin Connect, and MapMyRide. You can also import GPX files directly.

### How do I track a cycling activity?
From the dashboard, select "Activities" > "Start New Activity". You can track manually by starting/stopping as needed, or enable automatic tracking which uses GPS to detect when you're cycling.

### Can I edit a route after creating it?

Sync happens automatically when you're logged into the same account across devices and have an internet connection. For manual sync, go to Settings > Sync > Sync Now.

### Does EcoCycle work offline?
