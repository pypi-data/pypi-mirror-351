If a successful security patch can be created, a new, patched version of the software will be released and it is strongly recommended to remove the current _EcoCycle_ program & its dependancies.

The patched version will be available for download on the releases tab.

###### If not, the infected _EcoCycle_ version will be removed from the releases tab and the _EcoCycle_ team will work on a new version of the software that is not vulnerable to the security issue, under a new version number to avoid confusion.
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Until the said issue has been resolved, the _EcoCyle Team_ **strongly** recommends not hosting it and reverting back to the most recent secure version.
