# dcatoolkit
 Collection of useful modules and representations for managing DCA output data.

## Major Sections
### Representations
  * Use Pairs to load lists, tuples, sets, and ndarrays with the correct orientation of elements. This will allow you to yield integer pairs that can be mirrored (where y becomes x and vice versa) and to subset various pairs.
  * Use DirectInformationData to create 3-column structured ndarrays that can be sorted by "DI", mapped to a protein with a ResidueAlignment, and used to generate output for other programs (including UCSF Chimera)
  * Use ResidueAlignment to generate a reference map. Indices of one sequence of characters can be linked to their corresponding indices of the other sequence of characters. The dictionaries produced, domain-to-protein and protein-to-domain, allow for forward mapping and backmapping.
  * Use StructureInformation to find contacts in a protein structure and find atomic information related to specific pairs of interest.
### Analytics
  * Use MSATools to load in Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) data and provide functionality including generating frequency statistics on "gappiness" in the MSA and filtering and cleaning MSAs.
