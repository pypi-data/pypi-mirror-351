"""
Signed Distance Field (SDF) module for the BiFIS framework.

This module provides functionality to compute distance fields between point clouds,
which is essential for geometry-aware sampling in computational fluid dynamics.
The SDF class efficiently computes distances from target points to the nearest
source points (typically surface geometry), normalizes these distances, and
optionally transforms them using a custom function.

    Signed Distance Field computation between point clouds.

    Calculates the distance from each target point to the nearest source point,
