# Project Requirements Documentation

The files in this folder define the Project Requirements. These are **MANDATORY** to follow. Any deviation from this leads to losing your job. If any deviation needs to be done always ask the user.

Strictly follow the rules of your current Milestone when implementing any Task related to it. Only implement if you can find the answer here. If it's not here, it doesn't exist - ask the User if in doubt. Don't make up own ideas.
