# Task: Session Reconstruction & Metadata

## Description
Transform collections of parsed MessageRecord objects into complete ParsedSession objects with accurate conversation threading, metadata aggregation, and session validation. This builds on T01's parsing output to create intelligent session structures.

## Goal / Objectives
Convert flat lists of MessageRecord objects into rich, structured ParsedSession containers with conversation context and metadata.
- Reconstruct conversation threading using parent_uuid relationships
- Calculate session metadata (costs, tokens, tool usage)
- Assemble complete ParsedSession objects with all contextual information
- Validate session integrity and flag inconsistencies

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Conversation threading accurately follows parent_uuid relationships
- [x] Session metadata correctly aggregates costs, tokens, and message counts
- [x] Tool usage patterns extracted and structured from message content
- [x] ParsedSession provides complete view of session data and conversation flow
- [x] Session integrity validation detects and reports data inconsistencies
- [x] Works correctly with complex multi-branch conversations
- [x] Unit tests cover threading logic and metadata calculation

## Subtasks
- [x] Implement conversation threading algorithm using parent_uuid
- [x] Create session metadata calculation logic (costs, tokens, counts)
- [x] Extract and correlate tool usage information from messages
- [x] Implement ParsedSession assembly with all components
- [x] Add session validation and integrity checking
- [x] Handle edge cases: orphaned messages, circular references, missing parents
- [x] Write comprehensive tests for threading and metadata logic
