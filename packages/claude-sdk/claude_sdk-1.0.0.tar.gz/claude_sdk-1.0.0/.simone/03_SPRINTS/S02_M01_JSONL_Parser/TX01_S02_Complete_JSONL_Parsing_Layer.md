# Task: Complete JSONL Parsing Layer

## Description
Implement the complete JSONL parsing layer that converts raw Claude Code session files into validated, typed MessageRecord objects. This includes file discovery, line-by-line parsing, JSON deserialization with Pydantic validation, and robust error handling.

## Goal / Objectives
Build the foundation parsing layer that can reliably convert any Claude Code JSONL file into clean, typed Python objects.
- Discover Claude Code session files in user directories
- Parse JSONL files line-by-line with memory efficiency
- Convert JSON records to typed MessageRecord objects using existing Pydantic models
- Handle malformed data gracefully without stopping the entire parse

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `discover_sessions()` function finds all JSONL files in `~/.claude/projects/`
- [x] JSONL parser reads files line-by-line and handles large files efficiently
- [x] All valid JSONL records convert to MessageRecord objects using existing models
- [x] Parser continues processing despite individual malformed lines
- [x] Comprehensive error context provided for debugging malformed data
- [x] Memory usage stays reasonable for typical session files
- [x] Unit tests cover normal parsing and error scenarios

## Subtasks
- [x] Implement session file discovery utilities for `~/.claude/projects/`
- [x] Create JSONL file reader with line-by-line processing
- [x] Integrate JSON deserialization with existing Pydantic MessageRecord models
- [x] Implement error handling strategy for malformed lines
- [x] Add comprehensive logging for parse errors and warnings
- [x] Write unit tests for parsing logic and error scenarios
- [x] Test against real Claude Code JSONL data structure
