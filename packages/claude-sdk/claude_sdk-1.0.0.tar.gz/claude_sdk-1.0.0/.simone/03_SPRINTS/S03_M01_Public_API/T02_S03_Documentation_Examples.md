# Task: Comprehensive Documentation & Usage Examples

## Description
Create comprehensive documentation and practical usage examples specifically designed for Claude AI's CLI-based workflow. Since the primary user is Claude working with Bash, Read, Write, Edit tools, documentation must be discoverable via `help()` and examples must be immediately runnable.

**Documentation Strategy from Planning:**
- Rich docstrings with examples - discoverable via `help(load)`
- Working examples in `examples/` that can be run with `python examples/basic.py`
- Focus on CLI discovery patterns rather than web docs
- Examples that demonstrate the clean API: `session = load(path)`

## Goal / Objectives
Provide documentation optimized for CLI discovery and immediate usage.
- Rich docstrings for all public functions showing exact usage patterns
- Practical, runnable examples in `examples/` directory
- Focus on the core workflow: load session, analyze costs, examine tools
- Clear error handling patterns for common issues
- All examples use the finalized clean API

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `load()` function has rich docstring with Args, Returns, Raises, Examples showing CLI usage
- [x] `find_sessions()` function has comprehensive docstring with practical examples
- [x] `Session` class docstring documents all key properties: `total_cost`, `tools_used`, `messages`
- [x] At least 3 working examples in `examples/` directory demonstrating the clean API
- [x] `examples/basic_usage.py` - Simple session loading and cost analysis (implemented as basic_analysis.py)
- [x] `examples/tool_analysis.py` - Tool usage patterns and cost breakdown
- [x] `examples/message_filtering.py` - Working with messages, including sidechain filtering
- [x] All examples use new API: `session = load(path)` not old `parse_complete_session`
- [x] All examples are immediately runnable with `python examples/file.py`
- [x] Error handling patterns documented for common CLI scenarios
- [x] `help(claude_sdk)` shows useful module overview with import examples
- [x] `help(load)` shows complete usage example that can be copy-pasted

## Subtasks
- [x] Write comprehensive docstring for `load()` function with CLI-focused examples
- [x] Write comprehensive docstring for `find_sessions()` function with path examples
- [x] Enhance `Session` class docstring documenting properties and usage patterns
- [x] Create `examples/basic_usage.py` using clean API: `session = load(path)`
- [x] Create `examples/tool_analysis.py` showing cost breakdown and tool usage patterns
- [x] Create `examples/message_filtering.py` demonstrating message iteration and sidechain filtering
- [x] Update existing examples in `examples/` to use new clean API
- [x] Add inline examples to all major docstrings that can be copy-pasted
- [x] Document common error scenarios with CLI-friendly error handling
- [x] Test all examples run correctly with `python examples/file.py`
- [x] Verify `help()` output is useful for CLI discovery
- [x] Add module-level docstring showing the most common usage patterns
