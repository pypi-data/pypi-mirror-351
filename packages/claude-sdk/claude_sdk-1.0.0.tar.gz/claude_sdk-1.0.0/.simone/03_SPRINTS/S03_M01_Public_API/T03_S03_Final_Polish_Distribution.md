# Task: Final Polish & Distribution Readiness

## Description
Apply final polish to the library and prepare it for production distribution with a focus on Claude's CLI-based usage patterns. This includes optimizing error messages for CLI context, performance for large sessions, and comprehensive testing with real Claude Code session files.

**Key Polish Areas from Planning:**
- Error messages that are actionable in CLI context (not web UI)
- Performance optimization for large sessions (>1MB, >100 messages)
- End-to-end testing with real `~/.claude/projects/` session files
- PyPI packaging for easy `pip install claude-sdk` distribution
- Memory efficiency for bulk session processing

## Goal / Objectives
Deliver a production-ready library optimized for Claude's workflow and ready for distribution.
- CLI-friendly error messages with clear guidance
- Optimized performance for large sessions and bulk processing
- Proper PyPI packaging and distribution setup
- Comprehensive testing with real-world Claude Code session files
- Production-ready quality meeting all standards

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Error messages are CLI-friendly with actionable guidance (no web UI references)
- [ ] Performance optimized: parse 1MB session files in <2 seconds
- [ ] Memory efficient: handle 100+ message sessions without excessive memory usage
- [ ] `pyproject.toml` configured for PyPI distribution with proper metadata
- [ ] `README.md` has installation, basic usage with `session = load(path)` examples
- [ ] End-to-end tests work with real Claude Code session files from `~/.claude/projects/`
- [ ] All quality checks pass: `just check` (linting, type checking, testing, formatting)
- [ ] Library installs cleanly with `pip install claude-sdk`
- [ ] Package can be built with `just build` and distributed (research and fix if build fails)
- [ ] Testing with actual session files validates the complete workflow
- [ ] Performance benchmarks document expected memory/time usage for different session sizes

## Subtasks
- [ ] Review all error messages and make them CLI-friendly with actionable guidance
- [ ] Performance optimization: benchmark and optimize large session parsing (>1MB, >100 messages)
- [ ] Memory optimization: ensure reasonable memory usage for bulk session processing
- [ ] Update `README.md` with clean installation and usage guide featuring `session = load(path)`
- [ ] Configure `pyproject.toml` with proper PyPI metadata, dependencies, and build settings
- [ ] Create comprehensive end-to-end tests using real `~/.claude/projects/` session files
- [ ] Test library installation and imports in clean virtual environment
- [ ] Run full quality pipeline: `just check` (format, lint, typecheck, test)
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks documenting memory/time usage by session size
- [ ] Test package building with `just build` and distribution workflow (research/fix build issues)
- [ ] Final code review focusing on CLI usability and production readiness
- [ ] Document v1.0.0 release notes highlighting the clean API and CLI focus
