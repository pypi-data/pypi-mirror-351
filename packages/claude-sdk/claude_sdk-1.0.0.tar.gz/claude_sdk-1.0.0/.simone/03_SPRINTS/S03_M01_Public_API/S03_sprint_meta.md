# Sprint: Public API & Library Integration (S03)

## Sprint Goal
Create clean public interface and finalize the library for production use

## Scope & Key Deliverables

### T01_S03: Public API Interface Design & Implementation
- Clean `__init__.py` with intuitive exports: `parse_session`, `discover_sessions`
- Export key model classes: `ParsedSession`, `MessageRecord`, `SessionMetadata`
- Export error classes: `ParseError`, `ClaudeSDKError`
- Complete `__all__` list and proper type annotations
- Simple import pattern: `from claude_sdk import parse_session, ParsedSession`

### T02_S03: Comprehensive Documentation & Usage Examples
- Enhanced docstrings with Args, Returns, Raises, Examples sections
- Practical usage examples: basic parsing, session analysis, error handling
- Performance considerations and troubleshooting documentation
- Updated existing examples to use new public API
- Complete type annotations across public interface

### T03_S03: Final Polish & Distribution Readiness
- User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
- Performance optimization for large files (>1MB) and bulk operations
- PyPI distribution setup with proper packaging configuration
- End-to-end integration testing with real Claude Code sessions
- Comprehensive README.md and production-ready quality standards

## Task Overview
- **T01_S03_Public_API_Interface**: Clean public API exports and interface design
- **T02_S03_Documentation_Examples**: Comprehensive documentation and usage examples
- **T03_S03_Final_Polish_Distribution**: Performance optimization, error handling, and distribution readiness

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
**API Design (T01):**
- ✅ Simple, intuitive API: `from claude_sdk import parse_session, ParsedSession`
- ✅ All core functions and classes properly exported with type annotations
- ✅ `__all__` list complete and IDE autocompletion working

**Documentation (T02):**
- ✅ All public APIs have comprehensive docstrings with examples
- ✅ At least 3 practical usage examples in `examples/` directory
- ✅ Performance considerations and troubleshooting documentation

**Production Ready (T03):**
- ✅ parse_session works with any Claude Code session file from ~/.claude/
- ✅ discover_sessions finds all sessions in directories and handles errors gracefully
- ✅ User-friendly error messages guide users to solutions
- ✅ Performance optimized for large files (>1MB) and bulk operations
- ✅ Full basedpyright compliance across entire library
- ✅ Library ready for PyPI distribution with proper packaging
- ✅ End-to-end integration tests validate complete real-world workflows

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- Depends on S02 core parser being complete ✅
- **Primary end user: Claude AI via CLI tools** - Library designed for Claude's analysis workflows using Bash, Read, Write, Edit tools
- Focus on developer experience and ease of use for CLI-based interaction
- API must be obvious and discoverable via `help()` and rich docstrings
- This sprint delivers the final, usable library interface for M01 milestone
- Estimated completion: 1 week with 3 focused tasks
- Success metrics: Library can parse real Claude Code sessions, great DX, ready for distribution
