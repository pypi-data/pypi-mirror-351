# Task: MessageRecord Model

## Description
Implement the core MessageRecord Pydantic model that directly maps to Claude Code JSONL line structure. This is the central data structure that represents individual session records, including complete tool execution data (calls and results).

## Goal / Objectives
Create a comprehensive MessageRecord model that accurately represents JSONL data:
- Complete mapping of all JSONL fields to Pydantic model fields
- Proper handling of nested Message and TokenUsage structures
- Support for field aliases matching JSONL naming conventions
- Robust validation of UUID fields and datetime parsing
- Complete tool execution support (ToolUseBlock, ToolResultBlock, toolUseResult field)
- Full compatibility with real Claude Code session data

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] MessageRecord model with all required fields from JSONL structure
- [x] Nested Message model with role, content list, stop_reason, usage
- [x] TokenUsage model for input/output/cache token tracking
- [x] ToolResultBlock content block for tool execution results
- [x] ToolResult model for rich tool metadata (toolUseResult field)
- [x] Proper field aliases for snake_case to camelCase mapping
- [x] UUID validation for parent_uuid and uuid fields
- [x] Datetime parsing and validation for timestamp field
- [x] Path validation for cwd field
- [x] Optional field handling for cost_usd, duration_ms, request_id, tool_use_result, is_meta
- [x] Unit tests with real JSONL data examples
- [x] Full basedpyright compliance

## Subtasks
- [x] Create TokenUsage model with all token count fields
- [x] Create ToolResultBlock content block for tool execution results
- [x] Create ToolResult model for rich tool metadata with all schema fields
- [x] Create Message model with role, content, stop_reason, usage
- [x] Implement MessageRecord with all JSONL fields including tool_use_result
- [x] Configure field aliases (parentUuid, isSidechain, userType, toolUseResult, isMeta, etc.)
- [x] Add UUID validation for parent_uuid and uuid fields
- [x] Add datetime validation and parsing for timestamp
- [x] Add Path validation for cwd field
- [x] Configure optional fields with proper default handling
- [x] Update ContentBlock union to include ToolResultBlock
- [x] Create comprehensive unit tests with JSONL examples including tool results
- [x] Validate model can parse real session file records with tool execution

## Implementation Guidance
Reference the detailed model structure in `docs/PYTHON_CLAUDE_CODE_SDK_SPECIFICATION.md` lines 183-221 for complete field mapping. Critical points:
- Use Field(alias="...") for camelCase JSONL field names
- parent_uuid should be Optional[UUID] with None default
- cost_usd and duration_ms are optional performance metrics
- tool_use_result is Optional[Union[str, ToolResult]] with alias="toolUseResult"
- is_meta is Optional[bool] with alias="isMeta"
- content field uses discriminated union including ToolResultBlock
- ToolResult model must handle all tool-specific rich metadata fields
- Proper validation is essential for parsing real session data

## Related Documentation
- [Technical Specification](../../../docs/PYTHON_CLAUDE_CODE_SDK_SPECIFICATION.md) - Complete MessageRecord definition
- [PRD Core Session Parser](../../02_REQUIREMENTS/M01_Core_Session_Parser/PRD_Core_Session_Parser.md) - MessageRecord requirements (FR-2.1)

## Dependencies
- T01_S01_Foundation_Types must be completed (requires enums)
- T02_S01_Content_Block_Models must be completed (requires content blocks)

## Output Log
[2025-05-29 16:36]: Task specification updated to include complete tool execution support (ToolResultBlock, ToolResult model, toolUseResult field). Ready to proceed with implementation.
[2025-05-29 16:41]: Implemented all core models - TokenUsage, ToolResultBlock, ToolResult, Message, MessageRecord with complete JSONL field mapping and proper aliases. Updated ContentBlock union and exports.
[2025-05-29 16:46]: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - All models implemented with 74 tests passing, 0 type errors, perfect quality. Ready for code review.
[2025-05-29 16:54]: Code Review - FAIL
Result: **FAIL** - Critical deviations from specification found that prevent JSONL parsing compatibility.
**Scope:** T03_S01_Message_Record_Model implementation review against technical specifications.
**Findings:**
1. Missing `message_type` field in MessageRecord (Severity: 9/10) - Required for JSONL message type discrimination
2. Missing `request_id` field in MessageRecord (Severity: 8/10) - Required by specification
3. Incorrect Message content type constraint (Severity: 9/10) - Allows string content and wrong ContentBlock union
4. Incorrect ToolResult model structure (Severity: 10/10) - Completely different from specification requirements
5. TokenUsage missing validation constraints (Severity: 6/10) - Missing ge=0 constraints and defaults
**Summary:** Implementation deviates significantly from specification with missing required fields and incorrect data structures that break JSONL compatibility.
**Recommendation:** Immediate correction required to match specification exactly before proceeding. All 5 issues must be resolved to achieve spec compliance.
[2025-05-29 17:06]: ✅ ALL ISSUES FIXED - Specification compliance achieved! Added missing fields (message_type, request_id), fixed Message content constraint, corrected ToolResult structure, added TokenUsage validation. 74 tests passing, 0 type errors, perfect quality.
[2025-05-29 17:23]: ✅ TASK VERIFICATION COMPLETE - Confirmed implementation quality: 74 tests passing, 0 basedpyright errors/warnings/notes, all ruff checks passing. MessageRecord model fully implemented and tested.
[2025-05-29 17:31]: ✅ TASK COMPLETED - Code review PASS with high confidence. All acceptance criteria met, specification compliant, 74/74 tests passing. Task marked as completed.
