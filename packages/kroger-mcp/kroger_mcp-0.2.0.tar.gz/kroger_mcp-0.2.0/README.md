# üõí Kroger MCP Server üõçÔ∏è -- FastMCP for Kroger Shopping

A [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) server that provides AI assistants like Claude with seamless access to Kroger's grocery shopping functionality through the Model Context Protocol ([MCP](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/mcp)). This server enables AI assistants to find stores, search products, manage shopping carts, and access Kroger's comprehensive grocery data via the [kroger-api](https://github.com/CupOfOwls/kroger-api) python library.

## üì∫ Demo

Using Claude with this MCP server to search for stores, find products, and add items to your cart:

## Changelog
A changelog with recent changes is [here](CHANGELOG.md).

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
You will need Kroger API credentials (free from [Kroger Developer Portal](https://developer.kroger.com/)).
Visit the [Kroger Developer Portal](https://developer.kroger.com/manage/apps/register) to:
1. Create a developer account
2. Register your application
3. Get your `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, and set your `REDIRECT_URI`

The first time you run a tool requiring user authentication, you'll be prompted to authorize your app through your web browser. You're granting permission to **your own registered app**, not to any third party.

### Installation

#### Option 1: Using uvx with Claude Desktop (Recommended)
Once published to PyPI, you can use uvx to run the package directly without cloning the repository:

Edit Claude Desktop's configuration file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kroger": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "kroger-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "KROGER_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id",
        "KROGER_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret", 
        "KROGER_REDIRECT_URI": "http://localhost:8000/callback",
        "KROGER_USER_ZIP_CODE": "10001"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Benefits of this method:
- Automatically installs the package from PyPI if needed
- Creates an isolated environment for running the server
- Makes it easy to stay updated with the latest version
- Doesn't require maintaining a local repository clone

#### Option 2: Using uv with a Local Clone
First, clone locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CupOfOwls/kroger-mcp
```

Then, edit Claude Desktop's configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kroger": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/cloned/kroger-mcp",
        "run",
        "kroger-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "KROGER_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id",
        "KROGER_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret", 
        "KROGER_REDIRECT_URI": "http://localhost:8000/callback",
        "KROGER_USER_ZIP_CODE": "10001"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 3: Installing From PyPI

```bash
# Install with uv (recommended)
uv pip install kroger-mcp

# Or install with pip
pip install kroger-mcp
```

#### Option 4: Installing From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CupOfOwls/kroger-mcp
cd kroger-mcp

# Install with uv (recommended)
uv sync

# Or install with pip
pip install -e .
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your project root or pass in env values via the JSON config:

```bash
# Required: Your Kroger API credentials
KROGER_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
KROGER_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
KROGER_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/callback

# Optional: Default zip code for location searches
KROGER_USER_ZIP_CODE=90274
```

### Running the Server

```bash
# With uv (recommended)
uv run kroger-mcp

# With uvx (directly from PyPI without installation)
uvx kroger-mcp

# Or with Python directly
python server.py

# With FastMCP CLI for development
fastmcp dev server.py --with-editable .
```

### üß∞ Local-Only Cart Tracking

Since the Kroger API doesn't provide cart viewing functionality, this server maintains local tracking:

#### Local Cart Storage
- **File**: `kroger_cart.json`
- **Contents**: Current cart items with timestamps
- **Automatic**: Created and updated automatically

#### Order History
- **File**: `kroger_order_history.json`
- **Contents**: Historical orders with placement timestamps
- **Usage**: Move completed carts to history with `mark_order_placed`

### üöß Kroger Public API Limitations
- **View Only**: The `remove_from_cart` and `clear_current_cart` tools ONLY affect local tracking, not the actual Kroger cart
- **Local Sync**: Use these tools only when the user has already removed items from their cart in the Kroger app/website
- **One-Way**: Items can be added to the Kroger cart but not removed through the Public API. The Partner API would allow these things, but that requires entering a contract with Kroger.

| API | Version | Rate Limit | Notes |
|-----|---------|------------|-------|
| **Authorization** | 1.0.13 | No specific limit | Token management |
| **Products** | 1.2.4 | 10,000 calls/day | Search and product details |
| **Locations** | 1.2.2 | 1,600 calls/day per endpoint | Store locations and details |
| **Cart** | 1.2.3 | 5,000 calls/day | Add/manage cart items |
| **Identity** | 1.2.3 | 5,000 calls/day | User profile information |

**Note:** Rate limits are enforced per endpoint, not per operation. You can distribute calls across operations using the same endpoint as needed.

## üè´ Basic Workflow

1. **Set up a preferred location**:
   ```
   User: "Find Kroger stores near 90274"
   Assistant: [Uses search_locations tool]
   User: "Set the first one as my preferred location"
   Assistant: [Uses set_preferred_location tool]
   ```

2. **Search and add products**:
   ```
   User: "Add milk to my cart"
   Assistant: [Uses search_products, then add_items_to_cart]
   
   User: "Add bread, eggs, and cheese to my cart"
   Assistant: [Uses search_products for each, then bulk_add_to_cart]
   ```

3. **Manage cart and orders**:
   ```
   User: "What's in my cart?"
   Assistant: [Uses view_current_cart tool to see local memory]
   
   User: "I placed the order on the Kroger website"
   Assistant: [Uses mark_order_placed tool, moving current cart to the order history]
   ```
