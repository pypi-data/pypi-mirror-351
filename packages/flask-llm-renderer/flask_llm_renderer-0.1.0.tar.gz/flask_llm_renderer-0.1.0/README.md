# Flask LLM Renderer

## Overview

Another project on my journey to never write frontend code again. This is a decorator for Flask that allows you to render HTML from any recieved json response to a HTML page, that is updated in real-time to a server through websockets. (99 percent of this project was spent refining the html prompt :D)

Note: initial render is super slow for flask root view (probably due to eventlet and anthropic api conflict, silly bug), but after its ok :(

## Installation
We can either `pip install flask_llm_renderer` the package from PyPI or clone the repository and install it manually:
```bash
pip install build
python -m build
pip install dist/*.whl
```

## Example Usage

```python
python examples/example.py
```

You should be able to access the example at `http://localhost:5000/`. The example uses a simple Flask app that renders an initially empty page.

After you can curl a request to dynamically render an llm generated HTML page:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/render \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": {
      "location": "London",
      "forecast": [
        {"day": "Monday", "high": 18, "low": 10, "condition": "Rainy"},
        {"day": "Tuesday", "high": 20, "low": 11, "condition": "Cloudy"},
        {"day": "Wednesday", "high": 22, "low": 12, "condition": "Sunny"}
      ]
    }
  }'
```

Another example is:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/render \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

If you want specific styling, you can add extra detail in the 'extra-details' field in the json request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/render \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "30-Day Stock Price Comparison",
    "stocks": [
