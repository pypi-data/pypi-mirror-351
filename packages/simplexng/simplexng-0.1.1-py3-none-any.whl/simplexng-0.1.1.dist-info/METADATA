# SimpleXNG

SimpleXNG is a simplified package of [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) to
make it a single command to run for local use.

The [official install options](https://docs.searxng.org/admin/installation.html) for
SearXNG are a bit complex and assume admin privileges to set up.
This can be simplified a lot if you're just wanting to run it locally for your own use.

SimpleXNG is a tiny package to run SearXNG locally on macOS, Linux, or Windows:

- It uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage the Python dependencies.

- It omits Apache, Nginx, and Docker setup.

- It by default uses the
  [minimal template settings](https://github.com/searxng/searxng/blob/master/utils/templates/etc/searxng/settings.yml)
  with Redis and rate limiting turned off.
  (You can adjust the settings file if desired.)

- It vendors a recent copy of SearXNG so it is all available from PyPI for quick
  installation.

I wrote this since a friend was asking me why it wasn't easier to set up for "localhost"
use or embedded use.
So I thought I'd see if it worked as a minimal, modern uv package.

## Running

[Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) if you haven't
already.

To install:

```shell
uv tool install simplexng
```

To run:

```shell
simplexng --open
```

More options:

```shell
simplexng --help
```

Notes:

- On first run, it sets up a minimal config file (on macOS and Linux it will be
  `~/.config/simplexng/settings.yml`), which you can edit and will be used on subsequent
  runs.

- You can see the version of SearXNG being used with `simplexng --version`. If you want
  a newer or different build, you can clone this repo and run:
  ```shell
  ./scripts/clone_searxng.sh HEAD   # Or pick a revision
  uv run simplexng
  ```
