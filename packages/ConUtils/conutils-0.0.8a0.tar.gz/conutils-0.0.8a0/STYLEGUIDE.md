# Styleguide

## General 

Follow PEP8 standards on a basic level, pythonic code is encuraged - use a tool
like autopep8. Strict type checking is enforced, 
exceptions are evaluated on a per case basis.

### Classes

- should be structured as follows:

    #### head

    - `docstring`
    - `constructor`
    - `attributes` and `methods` outside the `constructor`,
    but only used by the `construcor`,
    these should **always** be private
    - for automatic doc generation add `# @constructor` in front of
    the `constructor`, this **includes** private constructor methods,
    as they serve as an extension of the constructor

    #### body
    - from top down: split into **`private`**, **`protected`** and **`public`**,
    to generate automatic docs, indicate sections with `# @private`, `# @protected`
    and `# @public`, ***if in use***
    - for every section: first define its `classattributes` and
    after define the `classmethods`
    - **note:** `properties` count as `attributes` and should be at
    the end of `classattributes`, it is best practice to follow the `property`
    declaration immediatly by its `setter`
    - **decorated `methods`** should be grouped at the top of `classmethods`
    sorted by occurrence

        ```python
        # NOT TYPEHINTED
        # MISSING DOCUMENTATION
        
        class Magician():
            """Magical docstring."""

        # @constructor

            def __init__(self, magic_wand):
                self._wand = magic_wand
                self.add_wand(magic_wand)
                self._magic = self.__merlin_conversion(magic_wand)

            def __merlin_conversion(self, magic_wand):
                # ...

        # @protected

            _wand_collection = [] 

            def _reset_magic(self):
                # ...
            
        # @public

            @property
            def magic(self):
                return self._magic
            
            @magic.setter
            def magic(self, magic):
                #...
                self._magic = magic
            
            @classmethod
            def add_wand(cls, wand):
                cls._wand_collection.append(wand)
            
            @classmethod
            def remove_wand(cls, wand):
                cls._wand_collection.remove(wand)

            @staticmethod
            def ask_merlin(args):
                # ...
                return merlin_answer

            def spell_effectiveness(self, spell):
                return self.ask_merlin((self._wand, self.magic, spell))
        ```

    #### notes
    - docindicators are **optional** but nice to have 
    - the above example has no `private` section and thus does not
    add the `# @private` indicator

    ### Code Structure

    This section is the most subject to change as the codebase grows and
    new methods might serve the purpose better.

    #### File Structure

    **Any** module includes an `__init__.py` regardles of actual need for one.
    Modules with the **most widespread use** are to be placed near the **top**
    of the file structure. Modules integral to **core functionality** might
    also be placed further **up**, to indicate their importance.
    Modules primarily using functionality of a given **parent module** might
    be grouped in a folder **inside** the parent module.

    ```
    src/project/
    ├── magic/                         
    │   ├── spells/
    │   │   ├── __init__.py
    │   │   └── fireball.py
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── magic.py   
    ...
    ```

    #### Packages

    The `__init__.py` file of any given package only exposes attributes
    from **inside** the module, this is done for ease of use.
    You **shall not** import in the `__init__.py` an attribute from outside
    the module. Files inside the module also **shall not** make use of the
    exposed parts defined in `__init__.py` and instead use relative imports.
    `__init__.py` files shall include the **relative file path** as a top comment.

    ```python 
    # project/magic/
    """Magic docstring
    
    @Exposes
        classes
            - :class: Magic
    """

    from .magic import Magic

    __all__ = ["Magic"]
    ```

    ```python 
    # project/magic/spells/fireball.py
    """Magic docstring
    
    """

    from ..magic import Magic


    ```

# Docstring Styleguide

## Usage

This guide aims to clarify how to write short and precise
documentation for packages, classes, methods, etc., to further understanding
of the codebase.

## Principles

### General

1. **Don't state the obvious**. Anything clearly stated by the **signature**
is redundant and thus should not be documented. Avoid phrases like
"This function does..." or "argument_x (int)".
 
2. The description is twofold: 
    - the first line should explain the **essential functionality**.
    - *if more explenation is needed it is to be done in the following lines
    and in as much depth as nessecary without overexplaining*
 
3. Use **bold** for key information, *italic* for optional behavior,
and `monospace` for anything in code eg. methods, variables, classes...

## Further specifying
 
- ### Methods, Functions and Classes
    
    - need to be typehinted, as types are not part of the documentation
    - may define an `Interface` section where clarification 
    on `inputs` and `outputs` is specified:
    
        ```python
        def function(x, y, magic: Magic.magic) -> magic_coordinates:
            """Process coordinates for a wizzard.

            Infuses `x` and `y` with `magic` and
            calls function :func:`process_magic`.

            Interface
                takes:
                    - magic: provides a spell,
                        see :class:`magic` in magic.py
            """
            # ...
        ```
    - #### after Interface
        - **functions and methods**: may define `takes` and `returns`
        - **classes**: may define `inherits`, public `methods` 
        and public `arguments`, any nonpublic attributes are to be explained
        in their respective method and/or the class description.
        Wrappers and decorators are to be treated from the public perspective.
    
- ### Packages

    - may define an `@Exposes` section as interface

        ```python
        # package/
        """Contains different kinds of spells, all making use of :class:`Spell`

        @Exposes
            classes
                - :class:Arcana
                - :class:Fire
                - :class:Mele
        """

        from .arcana import Arcana
        from .fire import Fire
        from .mele import Mele

        __all__ = ["Arcana", "Fire", "Mele"]
        ```

    - #### note the import structure:
        - packages should **only** expose the interface, **not** take in arguments,
        thus dependencies are declared on a per file basis via **relative import** 
        

            ```python
            # package/arcana.py

            from .. import Spell

            class Arcana(Spell):
                def __init__(self, ...)
                # ...
            ```
