INTRODUCTION TO ADVERSARIAL LEARNING FOR DATA MODELING:

    The modern excitement in adversarial learning for data modeling began with the
    paper "Generative Adversarial Nets" by Goodfellow, et al. Such learning
    involves two networks, a Discriminator and a Generator. we can think of the
    Discriminator as a function D(x,θ_d) where x is the image and θ_d the weights
    in the Discriminator network. The D(x,θ_d) function returns the probability
    that the input x is from the probability distribution that describes the
    training data. Similarly, we can think of the Generator as a function G(z,θ_g)
    that maps noise vectors to images that we want to look like the images in our
    training data. The vector θ_g represents the learnable parameters in the
    Generator network.

    We assume that the training images are described by some probability
    distribution that we denote p_data.  The goal of the Generator is to transform
    a noise vector, denoted z, into an image that should look like a training
    image.  Regarding z, we also assume that the noise vectors z are generated
    with a probability distribution p_Z(z).  Obviously, z is a realization of a
    vector random variable Z.  The output of the Generator consists of images that
    corresponds to some probability distribution that we will denote p_G.  So you
    can think of the Generator as a function that transforms the probability
    distribution p_Z into the distribution p_G.

    The question now is how do we train the Discriminator and the Generator
    networks.  The Discriminator is trained to maximize the probability of
    assigning the correct label to an input image that looks like it came from the
    same distribution as the training data.  That is, we want the parameters θ_d
    to maximize the following expectation:

          max   E           [log D(x)]                                                (1)
          θ_d    x ~ p_data

    The expression "x ~ p_data" means that x was pulled from the distribution
    p_data.  In other words, x is one of the training images.  While we are
    training D to exhibit the above behavior, we train the Generator for the
    following minimization:

          min   E         [log(1 − D(G(z)))]                                          (2)
          θ_g    z ~ p_Z

    Combining the two expressions shown above, we can express the combined
    optimization as:

                 _                                                                _
                |                                                                  |
      min  max  |  E           [log D(x)]      +     E         [log(1 − D(G(z)))]  | 
      θ_g  θ_d  |_  x ~ p_data                         z ~ p_Z                    _|
                                                                                      (3)

    Let's now see how we can translate this min-max form into a "protocol" for
    training the two networks.  For each training batch of images, we will first
    update the parameters in the Discriminator network and then in the Generator
    network.  If we use nn.BCELoss as the loss criterion, that will automatically
    take care of the logarithms in the expression shown above. The maximization of
    the first term simply requires that we use the target "1" for the network
    output D(x).  The maximization of the second term above is a bit more involved
    since it requires applying the Discriminator network to the output of the
    Generator that is fed noise at its input.  We want the value returned by D in
    the second term above to be as small as possible.  Therefore, for the second
    term, we use 0 as the target for the Discriminator. Recall that the
    Discriminator is a binary classifier (because it is based on the nn.BCELoss)
    and, therefore, its targets can only be 1 and 0.  After we have calculated the
    two losses for the Discriminator, we can sum the losses and call backwards()
    on the sum for calculating the gradients of the loss with respect to its
    weights.  A subsequent call to the step() of the optimizer would update the
    weights in the Discriminator network.

    For the training required for the Generator, only the second term inside the
    square brackets above matters.  Since the goal now is to minimize the overall
    form, that translates into minimizing the second term. However, because the
    logarithm is a monotonically increasing function and also because the output
    D(G(z)) will always be between 0 and 1, so the needed minimization translates
    into maximizing D(G(z)) with respect to a target value of 1.  With 1 as the
    target, we again find the nn.BCELoss associated with D(G(z)).  We call
    backwards() on this loss --- making sure that we have turned off
    'requires_grad()' on the Discriminator parameters as we are updating the
    Generator parameters. A subsequent call to the step() for the optimizer would
    update the weights in the Generator network.

DCGAN:

    The explanation presented above is how the training is carried out for the
    DCGAN implementations DG1 and DG2 in this file.  As stated elsewhere, DCGAN is
    short for "Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network". It owes its
    origins to the paper "Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep
    Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks" by Radford et al.  It was the
    first fully convolutional network for GANs

    The main thing about the Discriminator and the Generator networks in DCGAN is
    that the network layers are based on "4-2-1" parameters. For example, each
    layer (except for the final layer) of the Discriminator network carries out a
    strided convolution with a 4x4 kernel, a 2x2 stride and a 1x1 padding.  The
    final layer is also convolutional, but its corresponding parameters are
    "4-1-0".  The output of the final layer is pushed through a sigmoid to yield a
    scalar value as the final output for each image in a batch.  As for the
    Generator network, as is the case with the Discriminator, you again see the
    4-2-1 topology here.  A Generator's job is to transform a random noise vector
    into an image that is supposed to look like it came from the training dataset.


WGAN:

    As for the WGAN, as mentioned earlier, WGAN stands for "Wasserstein GAN" that
    is presented in the paper "Wasserstein GAN" by Arjovsky, Chintala, and Bottou.
    WGAN is based on estimating the Wasserstein distance between the distribution
    that corresponds to the training images and the distribution that has been
    learned so far by the Generator.  The starting point for understanding this
    distance is its following definition:

                                             _            _
                                            |              |
     W(P,Q)   =     inf         E           | || x  - y || |                          (4)
                  γ ∈  π(P,Q)    (x,y) ~ γ  |_            _|

    where π(P,Q) is the set of all possible joint distributions γ(X,Y) over two
    random variables X and Y, with both random variables drawing samples from the
    set of outcomes for an underlying random experiment.  The joint distributions
    γ(X,Y) under consideration are only those for which the marginal with respect
    to X is P and the marginal with respect to Y is Q.  The notation "(x,y) ~ γ"
    means that we are drawing the pair of samples (x,y) from the joint
    distribution γ(X,Y).  The joint distribution that yields the smallest value
    for the expectation of the norm shown above is the Wasserstein distance
    between the distributions P and Q.

    The definition of W(P,Q) shown above makes it computationally intractable
    because it requires that we carry out a Monte Carlo experiment that involves
    finding the norm "||x - y||" for EVERY possible pair (x,y) corresponding to
    EACH possible joint distribution in π(P,Q).  In addition, FOR EACH JOINT
    DISTRIBUTION γ, WE MUST FIND THE MEAN VALUE FOR THIS NORM.  What comes to our
    rescue is the following result from the Optimal Transport Theory:
    
                                    _                                  _
                                   |                                    |
    W(P,Q)   =         sup         |   E    f(x)      -      E    f(x)  |             (5)
                   ||f||_L =< 1    |    x~P                   y~Q       |
                                   |_                                  _|
    
    for all the 1-Lipschitz f: X→ R where X is the domain from which the elements
    x and y mentioned above are drawn and R is the range --- the set of all reals.
    The subscript "L" in "||f||_L =< 1" is supposed to express the fact that we
    are talking about Lipschitz functions.  This equation can also be interpreted
    as: there is guaranteed to exist a 1-Lipschitz continuous function f() that
    when applied to the samples drawn from the distributions P and Q will yield
    the Wasserstein distance between the two distributions through the following
    formula:

                                  _                                         _
                                 |                                           |
    W(P,Q)   =        max        |   E     [f(x)]      -      E      [f(y)]  |        (6)
                 ||f||_L =< 1    |    x~P                      y~Q           |
                                 |_                                         _|

    The challenge then becomes one of having to learn this unknown function f().
    This is the job that is assigned to the Critic Network in a WGAN.  But how do
    we enforce the condition that we only seek functions whose continuity
    properties are those of 1-Lipschitz functions?  While, technically speaking,
    this remains an unsolved problem, the WGAN authors have presented an ad hoc
    approach that appears to work in practice.  Their suggested approach consists
    of CLIPPING THE VALUES of the parameters of the Critic Network so that they
    lie in a very narrow band of values.  The implementation of WGAN in this file
    does the same.

    Regarding my mention of Lipschitz functions above, while you will find a more
    formal definition in my Week 11 slides, suffice it to say here that these are
    functions that are guaranteed to change their values slowly over the domain on
    which they are defined.  For a k-Lipschitz function, its value change over a
    Euclidean distance in the domain must be less than k times that distance

    Going back to the formula shown above, it is the Wasserstein distance between
    a true distribution P and a learned approximation Q to it.  Assuming that the
    function f() needed for the calculation of the distance can be learned in a
    GAN-based framework, let C symbolically represent this learned
    function. Remember, our overarching goal remains that we need to also learn a
    Generator G that is capable of converting noise into samples that look like
    those from the distribution P.  The framework must learn G that MINIMIZES the
    Wasserstein distance between the true distribution P and its learned
    approximation Q.  At the same time, the GAN-based framework must discover a C
    that seeks to maximize the same distance (in the sense that the Critic learns
    how to maximally distrust the Generator G).  We thus end up with the following
    minimax objective for the learning framework:

                     _                                               _
                    |                                                 |
          min  max  |  E      [C(x)]      -     E         [C(G(z))]   |                  (7)
           G    C   |_  x ~ P                    z ~ p_Z             _|
                                                                                       
           
    In comparing this minimax objective with the one shown earlier in Equation
    (3), note that the two components of the argument to the minimax in Eq. (3)
    were additive, whereas we subtract them in the objective shown above.  In
    Eq. (3), we had a Discriminator in the GAN and our goal was to maximize its
    classification performance for images that look like they came from the true
    distribution P. On the other hand, the goal of the Critic here is to learn to
    maximize the Wasserstein distance between the true distribution P and its
    learned approximation Q.  Note that the distribution Q is for the images that
    are constructed by the Generator from the white-noise samples z drawn from the
    distribution p_z shown above.

    As far as the Critic is concerned, the maximization needed above can be
    achieved by using the following loss function:

                                     _    _              _    _
                                    |      |            |      |
           Critic Loss     =     E  | C(y) |    -    E  | C(x) |
                                y~Q |_    _|        x~P |_    _|

                                      _       _              _    _
                                     |         |            |      |
                           =     E   | C(G(z)) |     -    E | C(x) |                   (8)
                                z~p_z|_       _|         x~P|_    _|


    In the WGAN code shown in this file, this is accomplished by using a "gradient
    target" of -1 for the mean output of the Critic when it sees the real images
    in the training dataset and the "gradient target" of +1 for the mean output of
    the Critic when it sees the images produced by the Generator.  By gradient
    here, we are talking about the gradient of the Wasserstein distance with
    respect to the learnable parameters. If we assume that the true values of the
    learnable parameters are related to their current estimates by an affine
    relationship, using these gradient targets makes sense, as shown by the
    authors.

WGAN with GP:

    The name extension "GP" stands for "Gradient Penalty".  It was shown by
    Gulrajani, Ahmed, Arjovsky, Dumouli, and Courville in their paper "Improved
    Training of Wasserstein GANs" (which followed the original WGAN publication)
    that implementing a 1-Lipschitz constraint with weight clipping biases the
    Critic towards learning simple probability distribution functions.  This paper
    showed how the performance of a WGAN could be improved by putting to use the
    theoretical property that the optimal WGAN critic has unit gradient norm (with
    respect to its inputs) almost everywhere under P and Q. [See Proposition 1,
    Corollary 1 of the paper cited in this paragraph.]

    In a WGAN-GP, we add a Gradient Penalty term to the Critic Loss that was shown
    earlier in Eq. (8):

                         _       _              _    _             _                      _  
                        |         |            |      |           |                        |^2 
   Critic Loss  =   E   | C(G(z)) |     -    E | C(x) |    +    λ.| ||∇_x̂ C(x̂) ||^2  − 1   |
                   z~p_z|_       _|         x~P|_    _|           |_                     _ |

                 \______________________________________/      \_____________________________/
                          Original Critic Loss                    The Gradient Penalty (GP)

                                                                                              (9)        

    The gradient in the GP term is of the output of the 1-Lipschitz function
    (meaning the Critic itself) with respect to its input.  Since the Critic sees
    both the training samples and those produced by the Generator at its input,
    for the purpose of calculating the gradient, we construct samples by taking a
    weighted sum of those drawn from the training data and those produced by the
    Generator:

               x̂  ←  εx  +  (1 − ε) x̃

    We feed such samples into the Critic and, based on its input-output values,
    estimate the gradient needed in the GP term in Eq. (9).


DCGAN vs. WGAN --- Implementation Perspective:

    1.  Both DCGAN and WGAN are based on adversarial learning that involves two
        networks, with one network serving as a Generator that transforms noise
        vectors into samples that are supposed to look similar to what you have in
        the training data, and the other network that learns to become adept at
        recognizing the training data samples, while, at the same time, learning
        to not trust the output of the Generator. This other network is called a
        Discriminator in DCGAN and a Critic in WGAN.

    2.  The learning in both DCGAN and WGAN is based on fulfilling a a min-max
        objective.

    3.  For the DCGAN, the min-max objective translates into a rather simple
        learning strategy in which, at each training iteration, the goal is to
        maximize the probability that the Discriminator will recognize the
        training images correctly and also maximize the probability that the image
        produced by the Generator is fake.  The min in the min-max objective is
        for training the Generator.  What's so cool is that this min part of the
        min-max object causes the Generator to produce an output that would trick
        the Discriminator into believing that it is genuine.

    4.  The Discriminator in a DCGAN is just a binary classifier. Its output
        produced by nn.Sigmoid is a scalar that expresses the probability that the
        image at the input to the Discriminator belongs to the training dataset.

    5.  On the other hand, the Critic in a WGAN is complex --- because its mission
        is to estimate the Wasser Distance between the probability distribution
        that describes the training images and the probability distribution
        associated with the images that the Generator is capable of producing.
        For that, it needs to learn a function that we call the Critic function
        C().

    6.  As shown by Eq. (8) above, using the Critic function C() in a WGAN
        involves an expectation.  This implies that you need a loop inside the
        main training loop. In the code shown for the function run_wgain_code(),
        you will see an inner loop inside the main train loop, the inner loop is
        run ncritic number of times for each iteration of the output loop.

    7.  At this point, one might ask: Since the function C() learned by the Critic
        in a WGAN is supposed to be a 1-Lipschitz function, how does one ensure
        that?  This is done by clipping the learnable weights in the Critic. [This
        was a heuristic strategy suggested by the original authors of WGAN to
        satisfy the 1-Lipschitz condition.]  The AdversarialLearning class has a
        constructor parameter called 'clipping_threshold' exactly for that
        purpose.
        
    8.  The target for Discriminator learning in a DCGAN is as simple as it can
        be: 1 and 0.  That's because a Discriminator is a binary classifier. When
        it trusts the input, it uses the target 1 and when it doesn't, it uses the
        target 0.  What exactly are the targets in Critic learning, considering
        that a Critic is NOT a classifier?  The Critic uses "gradient targets"
        during training.  When it sees an image at its input that can be trusted,
        it associates a "gradient target" of -1 with that.  Contrarily, when it
        does not trust the input image (say, because it was produced by the
        Generator), it sets the "gradient target" to +1.  That means that the
        Critic network must output an average estimate for the gradient that may
        be compared with either the target -1 or the target +1. These gradients
        refer to the gradient of the output vis-a-vis the input. In the training
        code for the function run_wgan_code(), you will see the following
        statements that carry out such comparisons:

              critic_output.backward( one )                 

              critic_output.backward( minus_one )  

        where the variables 'one' and 'minus_one' stand, respectively, for +1 and
        -1.  If you are surprised by this syntax, note that when 'backward()' is
        called with an argument, the argument is used as the target.  This way of
        calling 'backward()' is different from the more commonly used syntax:

              loss.backward()

    9.  The Generator network is the same for both DCGAN and WGAN.


Finally:

    If you wish to use this module to learn about data modeling with adversarial
    learning, your entry points should be the following scripts in the
    ExamplesAdversarialLearning directory of the distro:

        1.  dcgan_DG1.py            

        2.  dcgan_DG2.py   

        3.  wgan_CG1.py             

        4.  wgan_with_gp_CG2.py             

    The first script demonstrates the DCGAN logic on the PurdueShapes5GAN dataset.
    In order to show the sensitivity of the basic DCGAN logic to any variations in
    the network or the weight initializations, the second script introduces a
    small change in the discriminator network used by the first script.  The third
    script is a demonstration of using the Wasserstein distance for data modeling
    through adversarial learning. The last script shows how WGAN training can be
    improved with gradient penalty.  The results produced by these scripts (for
    the constructor options shown in the scripts) are included in a subdirectory
    named RVLCloud_based_results.

        This is an implementation of the DCGAN Generator. As was the case with the Discriminator network,

        vector into an image that is supposed to look like it came from the training dataset. (We refer 
        to the images constructed from noise vectors in this manner as fakes.)  As you will see later 
        in the "run_gan_code()" method, the starting noise vector is a 1x1 image with 100 channels.  In 
        order to output 64x64 output images, the network shown below use the Transpose Convolution 
        operator nn.ConvTranspose2d with a stride of 2.  If (H_in, W_in) are the height and the width 
        of the image at the input to a nn.ConvTranspose2d layer and (H_out, W_out) the same at the 
        output, the size pairs are related by

                ##  "1 - D(G(z))" which, since D is constrained to lie in the interval (0,1), requires that 
                ##  we maximize D(G(z)).  We accomplish that by applying the Discriminator to the output 
                ##  of the Generator and use 1 as the target for each image:

                ##  just optimizerG as shown later below; and (2) We call "netD.zero_grad()" at the beginning of
