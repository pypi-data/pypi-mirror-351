INTRODUCTION TO METRIC LEARNING:

    The main idea of metric learning is to learn a mapping from the images to
    their embedding vector representations in such a way that the embeddings for
    what are supposed to be similar images are pulled together and those for
    dissimilar images are pulled as far apart as possible.  After such a mapping
    function is learned, you can take a query image (whose class label is not
    known), run it through the network to find its embedding vector, and,
    subsequently, assign to the query images the class label of the nearest
    training-image neighbor in the embedding space.  As explained in my Metric
    Learning lecture in the Deep Learning class at Purdue, this approach to
    classification is likely to work under data circumstances when the more neural
    network classifiers fail.

    Two commonly used loss functions for metric learning are Pairwise Contrastive
    Loss and Triplet Loss.  

    Pairwise Contrastive Loss is based on extracting all the Positive and the
    Negative Pairs of images form a batch.  For a Positive Pair, both the images
    in the pair must have the same label, and, for a Negative Pair, the two labels
    must be different.  A minimization of the Pairwise Contrastive Loss should
    decrease the distance between the embedding vectors for a Positive Pair and
    increase the distance between the embedding vectors for a Negative Pair.  If
    the two embeddings in a Negative Pair are already well separated, there would
    be no point to have them contribute to the loss calculation.  This is
    accomplished by incorporating the notion of a margin.  The idea is that we
    want to increase the distance between the two embeddings in a Negative Pair to
    the value specified by the Margin and no more. Should it be the case that two
    such embeddings are already separated by a distance greater than the Margin,
    we do not include such pairs in the loss calculation.

    Triplet Loss, on the other hand, starts with the notion of triplets (i,j,k) of
    the indices for triplets of images in a batch, with no two of the indices
    being the same. The image indexed by i is considered to be the Anchor in the
    triplet, the image indexed by j as Positive, and the one by k as the Negative.
    We also refer to such triplets with the notation (Anchor, Pos, Neg).  We again
    need the notion of a Margin. When we form the (Anchor, Pos, Neg) triplets from
    a batch, we focus on only those Neg images that are further away from the
    Anchor than the Pos image, but no farther than the (Anchor,Pos) distance plus
    the Margin.  Including the Negative images that are closer than the (Anchor,
    Pos) distance can make the learning unstable and including the Negatives that
    farther than the "(Anchor,Pos) plus the Margin" distance is likely to be
    wasteful.

    Forming set of Positive and Negative Pairs for the Pairwise Contrastive Loss
    and forming sets of Triplets for the Triplet Loss is referred to as Mining a
    batch.  This allows us to talk about concepts like "negative-hard mining",
    "negative semi-hard mining", etc., that depend on the relative distances
    between the images in the Negative Pairs and the distance of a negative
    vis-a-vis those in a Positive Pair.


    PROGRAMMING CHALLENGES:


    To calculate the Pairwise Contrastive Loss, you must be first extract Positive
    and Negative Pairs from a batch.  A Positive Pair means that both the
    embeddings in the pair carry the same class label and a Negative Pair means
    that the two embeddings in the pair have dissimilar labels.  From a
    programming standpoint, the challenge is how to form these pairs without
    scanning through a batch with 'for' loops --- since such loops are an anathema
    to any GPU based processing of data. What comes to our rescue are a
    combination of the broadcast properties of tensors (inherited from numpy) and
    tensor-based Boolean logic. For example, by comparing a column tensor of the
    sample labels in a batch with a row tensor of the same and testing for the
    equality of the sample labels, you instantly have a 2D array whose (i,j)
    element is True if the i-th and the j-th batch samples carry the same class
    label.

    Even after you have constructed the Positive and the Negative Pairs from a
    batch, your next mini-challenge is to reformat the batch sample indices in the
    pairs in order to conform to the input requirements of PyTorch's loss function
    torch.nn.CosineEmbeddingLoss.  The input consists of three tensors, the first
    two of which are of shape (N,M), where N is the total number of pairs
    extracted from the batch and M the size of the embedding vectors. The first
    such NxM tensor corresponds to the fist batch sample index in each pair. And
    the second such NxM tensor corresponds to the second batch sample index in
    each pair. The last tensor in the input args to the CosineEmbeddingLoss loss
    function is of shape Nx1, in which the individual values are either +1.0 or
    -1.0, depending on whether the pair formed by the first two embeddings is a
    Positive Pair or a Negative Pair.

    The programming challenge for calculating the Triplet Loss is similar to what
    it is for the Pairwise Contrastive Loss: How to extract all the triplets from
    a batch without using 'for' loops.  The first step is to form array index
    triplets (i,j,k) in which two indices are the same.  If B is the batch size,
    this is easily done by first forming a BxB array that is the logical negation
    of a Boolean array of the same size whose True values are only on the
    diagonal.  We can reshape this BxB Boolean array into three BxBxB shaped
    Boolean arrays, the first in which the True values exist only where i and j
    values are not the same, the second in which the True values occur only when i
    and k index values are not the same, and the third that has True values only
    when the j and k index values are not the same.  By taking a logial AND of all
    three BxBxB Boolean arrays, we get the result we want.  Next, we construct a
    BxBxB Boolean tensor in which the True values occur only where the first two
    index values imply that their corresponding labels are identical and where the
    last index corresponds to a label that does not agree with that for the first
    two index values.

    Even after you have formed the triplets, your next mini-challenge is to
    reformat the triplets into what you need to feed into the PyTorch loss
    function torch.nn.TripletMarginLoss. The loss function takes three arguments,
    each of shape (N,M) where N is the total number of triplets extracted from the
    batch and M the size of the embedding vectors.  The first such NxM tensor is
    the Anchor embedding vectors, the second for the Positive embedding vectors,
    the last for the Negative embedding vectors.


    EXAMPLE SCRIPTS:

    If you wish to use this module to learn about metric learning, your entry
    points should be the following scripts in the ExamplesMetricLearning directory
    of the distro:

        1.  example_for_pairwise_contrastive_loss.py

        2.  example_for_triplet_loss.py

    As the names imply, the first script demonstrates using the Pairwise
    Contrastive Loss for metric learning and the second script using the Triplet
    Loss for doing the same.  Both scripts can work with either the pre-trained
    ResNet-50 trunk model or the homebrewed network supplied with the
    MetricLearning module.

        For the Triplet Loss, you construct triplets of the samples in a batch in which the
        first two embeddings must carry the same class label and the label of the third
        embedding must not be same as for the other two.  Such a triplet is commonly
        denoted (Anchor, Pos, Neg).  That is, you treat the first element as the Anchor,
        the second as the Positive and the third as the Negative.  A triplet is formed
        only if the distance between the Anchor and the Neg is greater than the distance
        between the Anchor and the Pos.  We want all such Neg element to get farther away
        from the Anchor compared to how far the Pos element is --- but no farther than
        what's known as the Margin.  The idea is that if the Neg element is already beyond
        the Margin distance added to how far the Pos is, the Neg is already well separated
        from Pos and would not contribute to the learning process.

        The programming challenge for calculating the Triplet Loss is similar to what it
        is for the Pairwise Contrastive Loss: How to extract all the triplets from a batch

        that has True values only when the j and k index values are not the same.  By

        """
        To calculate the Pairwise Contrastive Loss, you must be first extract Positive and
        Negative Pairs from a batch.  A Positive Pair means that both the embeddings in
        the pair carry the same class label and a Negative Pair means that the two
        embeddings in the pair have dissimilar labels.  From a programming standpoint, the
        challenge is how to form these pairs without scanning through a batch with 'for'
        loops --- since such loops are an anathema to any GPU based processing of
        data. What comes to our rescue are a combination of the broadcast properties of
        tensors (inherited from numpy) and tensor-based Boolean logic. For example, by
        comparing a column tensor of the sample labels in a batch with a row tensor of the
        same and testing for the equality of the sample labels, you instantly have a 2D
        array whose (i,j) element is True if the i-th and the j-th batch samples carry the
        same class label.

        Even after you have constructed the Positive and the Negative Pairs from a batch,
        your next mini-challenge is to reformat the batch sample indices in the pairs in
        order to conform to the input requirements of PyTorch's loss function
        torch.nn.CosineEmbeddingLoss.  The input consists of three tensors, the first two
        of which are of shape (N,M), where N is the total number of pairs extracted from
        the batch and M the size of the embedding vectors. The first such NxM tensor
        corresponds to the fist batch sample index in each pair. And the second such NxM
        tensor corresponds to the second batch sample index in each pair. The last tensor
        in the input args to the CosineEmbeddingLoss loss function is of shape Nx1, in
        which the individual values are either +1.0 or -1.0, depending on whether the pair
        formed by the first two embeddings is a Positive Pair or a Negative Pair.
