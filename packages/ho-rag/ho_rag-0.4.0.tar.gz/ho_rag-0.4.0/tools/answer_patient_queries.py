async def answer_doctor_queries(patient_name:str, query:str) -> str:
    """
        Answers a medical query for a specific patient using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system powered by the OpenAI Chat Completions API.

        This function takes in the name of a patient and a natural language query related to that patient. 
        It then interacts with an OpenAI language model integrated with an indexer and data source 
        (commonly known as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation setup). The indexer retrieves relevant 
        context-specific medical data or notes about the patient, which are combined with the query to 
        generate a precise and context-aware response from the LLM.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        patient_name : str
            The name of the patient for whom the query is being made. This is used to identify and retrieve 
            relevant patient-specific information from the external data source.
        
        query : str
            A natural language question or statement about the patient. This could involve medical history, 
            treatment details, medications, lab reports, or any other patient-related information.

        Returns:
        --------
        str
            The AI-generated response to the query, informed by both the retrieved patient-specific data 
            and the language model's reasoning.

        Example:
        --------
        >>> answer_doctor_queries("John Doe", "What were the symptoms of John Doe?")
        'John Doe has back pain.'

    """
    Retrieves patient records from a MongoDB collection filtered by age range and units,
    then asynchronously processes each patientâ€™s data to determine if they meet a specified condition.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Queries the MongoDB collection for patients whose age is between `start_range_age` and `end_range_age`
       and whose age unit matches `units` ("years" or "months").
    2. Converts the MongoDB cursor to a list of patient documents.
    3. For each patient document, calls a synchronous function to extract details relevant to a medical query.
    4. Calls an asynchronous decision function (`safe_get_decision`) to evaluate the condition for each patient,
       managing concurrency to avoid API rate limits.
    5. Collects and returns a list of patient names where the condition evaluation returned "Yes".

    Args:
        start_range_age (int): The minimum age (inclusive) for filtering patients.
        end_range_age (int): The maximum age (inclusive) for filtering patients.
        units (str): The age unit to filter by, typically "years" or "months".
        condition (str): The medical condition query to evaluate for each patient.

    Returns:
        list[str]: A list of patient names who meet the specified condition.
