If all you need to do with Git is making branches, pushing, and syncing,
  this collection of command-line commands may simplify your workflow.
Well, it simplifies mine, a hundred times per day.

First, install [Python3], [Git], [pip], [gh], and [Bash]. Then:

```bash
pip install gitted
```

Then, in order to make a contribution to a GitHub repo, assuming
you've a made a fork already and cloned it (in the command line):

1. Start a branch, to resolve issue no. 42 (for example):

```bash
branch 42
```

1. Write some code and then add+commit it (no push):

```bash
commit
```

1. Write some code and then add+commit+push it:

```bash
push
```

1. Pull recent changes from the `master` of the uplink:

```bash
pull
```

Don't forget to define `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with the
[OpenAI key].
Also, don't forget to authenticate with `gh auth`.

## Conventions

In order to work smoothly, you have to respect a few conventions:

* Branch names are always integers, equal to GitHub issue numbers
* The main branch is `master`
* All commits are GPG-signed ([how?][gpg])
* The `origin` is the fork, while the `upstream` is the main repo ([why?][fork])

Maybe in future versions we make it configurable.
However, at the moment, that's what we have.

## How to Contribute

Install [GNU make] and [uv]. Then, run:

```bash
make
```

Should build.
If it doesn't, submit a bug report.
