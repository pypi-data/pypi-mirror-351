# ActiveCampaign MCP Server

ActiveCampaign's MCP server is now available as a beta release. This enables AI clients to seamlessly take ActiveCampaign actions and interact with your ActiveCampaign data, opening up powerful new integration possibilities for our ecosystem. For more information and to provide feedback, visit https://www.activecampaign.com/mcp

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an emerging standard that allows AI models to interact with applications through a consistent interface. It acts as an abstraction layer over HTTP, letting AI agents access application functionality without needing to understand specific API protocols.

## Beta Notice

The ActiveCampaign MCP Server is currently in beta. Features and functionality may change as we continue to improve the integration.

## Pre-requisites

Visit [this link](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for detailed instructions on installing uv, a python package manager required to run the MCP server locally.

### Finding your API token and URL in ActiveCampaign:

Reference [here](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/207317590-Getting-started-with-the-API) for instructions on finding your ActiveCampaign API token and URL.

## Using the MCP Server

### Claude Desktop

Download Claude Desktop [here](https://claude.ai/download).

Add the server configuration to your Claude Desktop config file (usually located at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` in macOS) and restart Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "activecampaign": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "ac-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "AC_API_TOKEN": "<YOUR AC API TOKEN>",
        "AC_API_URL": "<YOUR AC API URL>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Save the file and restart Claude. You should now be able to access all the tools!

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "activecampaign": {

      "args": [
        "ac-mcp-server"
