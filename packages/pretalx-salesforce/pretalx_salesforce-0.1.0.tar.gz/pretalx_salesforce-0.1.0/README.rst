SalesForce integration
==========================

This is a plugin for `pretalx`_ that serves to send speaker and proposal information to SalesForce.

Information is sent every eight hours or on manual sync, and is mapped as follows:

- Users and their speaker profiles are sent as contacts:
    - Contact.pretalx_LegacyID__c is set to the pretalx user ID
    - Contact.FirstName is set to the first part of a user’s name, separated by whitespace.
    - Contact.LastName is set to any remaining part of a user’s name.
    - Contact.Email is set to the user’s email address.
    - Contact.Biography__c is set to the user’s biography.
    - Contact.pretalx_Profile_Picture__c is set to the user’s profile picture URL.
- Submission objects are set synced to the custom Session object:
    - CreatedDate is set to the submission’s creation date.
    - pretalx_LegacyID__c is set to the submission’s pretalx ID.
    - Name is set to the submission’s title.
    - Session_Title__c is the submission’s full title, as Name is truncated to 80 characters.
    - Track__c is set to the submission’s track (by name, not by ID).
    - Submission_Format__c is set to the submission’s type (by name, not by ID).
    - Status__c is set to the submission’s status.
    - Abstract__c is set to the submission’s abstract plus the submission’s description, separated by two newlines and then stripped of whitespace.
    - Pretalx_Record__c is set to the submission’s public URL.
- The mapping between Contacts and Sessions is synced to the custom Contact_Session__c object:
    - Contact__c is set to the Salesforce Contact.
    - Session__c is set to the Salesforce Session.
