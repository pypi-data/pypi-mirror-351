    """
    Extracts and processes regions from the audio annotations in order to output regions suitable for calculating
    listened time and assigning tokens to top3/top4/surplus.

    There is a number of region types in cha files: subregion, makeup, extra, silence, etc. These regions have a
    hierarchy: e.g., time in makeup is considered to be only belonging to this makeu region and not the subregion it
    is in. This is necessary for calculating time that was listened to by annotators. But we will also use it here,
    because we want tokens within skips not to be counted as belonging to the subregion they are in, etc. We refer to
    the regions that have any overlaps removed according to this hierarchy as "processed" regions.

    The code that reads and processes these regions is in blabpy.seedlings.listen_time. It won't work as is for
    assigning tokens to surplus/top3/top4 regions, because it assumes that months 6 and 7 have no subregions. So we
    will have to do some of the processing ourselves.

    Special cases:
    - 20_02: subregion with rank (and coincidentally position) 3 was skip during annotation.
    Effectively it was treated as a subregion with rank 5 while subregions ranked 4 and 5 were treated as subregions
    with ranks 3 and 4. So, we will pretend as if these were the actual ranks.
    - 06_07, 22_07: all subregions minus
    silent part don't add up to four hours. We will manually add "extra" time to them.
    - 25_12: makeup regions in sugregion ranked 5 were not marked as "makeup".
