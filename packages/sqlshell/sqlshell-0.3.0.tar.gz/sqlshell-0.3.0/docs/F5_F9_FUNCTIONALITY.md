# F5/F9 SQL Execution Functionality

This document describes the new modular F5/F9 execution functionality added to SQLShell, which allows you to execute SQL statements individually or all at once.

## Overview

The F5/F9 functionality provides a convenient way to execute SQL statements in your editor:

- **F5**: Execute all SQL statements in the editor
- **F9**: Execute the current SQL statement (the statement containing the cursor)
- **Ctrl+Enter**: Execute the entire editor content (existing behavior)

## Features

### ðŸš€ Key Features

1. **Smart Statement Parsing**: Automatically detects individual SQL statements separated by semicolons
2. **Comment Handling**: Properly handles SQL comments (`--` and `/* */`) and string literals
3. **String Literal Support**: Correctly handles semicolons inside string literals
4. **Cursor-Based Execution**: F9 executes only the statement where your cursor is positioned
5. **Visual Feedback**: Clear status messages showing which statement was executed
6. **Non-Destructive**: Doesn't modify your original query text

### ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases

- **Development**: Test individual queries while developing complex multi-statement scripts
- **Debugging**: Execute specific statements to isolate issues
- **Data Exploration**: Run different analytical queries sequentially
- **Migration Scripts**: Execute database migration statements one by one

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

1. **Write Multiple SQL Statements**: Separate each statement with a semicolon (`;`)
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Engineering';
   
   SELECT * FROM projects WHERE status = 'Active';
   
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM assignments;
   ```

2. **Execute All Statements (F5)**:
   - Press `F5` or click the "F5 - Execute All" button
   - All statements will be executed sequentially
   - Results from the last statement will be displayed

3. **Execute Current Statement (F9)**:
   - Place your cursor anywhere within a SQL statement
   - Press `F9` or click the "F9 - Execute Current" button
   - Only that statement will be executed

### Advanced Examples

#### Example 1: Data Analysis Workflow
```sql
-- Step 1: Get basic employee stats
SELECT department, COUNT(*) as emp_count, AVG(salary) as avg_salary
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department;

-- Step 2: Find high performers
SELECT name, department, salary
FROM employees 
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees)
ORDER BY salary DESC;

-- Step 3: Project workload analysis
SELECT p.project_name, COUNT(a.employee_id) as team_size
FROM projects p
LEFT JOIN assignments a ON p.project_id = a.project_id
GROUP BY p.project_name
ORDER BY team_size DESC;
```

#### Example 2: Database Setup Script
```sql
-- Create temporary table
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_analysis AS
SELECT department, AVG(salary) as avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;

-- Analyze the data
SELECT * FROM temp_analysis WHERE avg_salary > 65000;

-- Clean up
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS temp_analysis;
```

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

The F5/F9 functionality is implemented using a modular architecture:

```
sqlshell/
â”œâ”€â”€ execution_handler.py      # Core parsing and execution logic
â”œâ”€â”€ editor_integration.py     # Integration with SQLEditor
â””â”€â”€ query_tab.py             # UI integration
```

### Key Components

1. **SQLExecutionHandler**: Parses SQL text and handles execution
2. **ExecutionKeyHandler**: Manages F5/F9 key press events
3. **EditorExecutionIntegration**: Integrates with existing SQLEditor

### Statement Parsing Features

- **Comment Removal**: Safely removes `--` and `/* */` comments while preserving string literals
- **String Handling**: Properly handles single and double quotes, including escaped quotes
- **Semicolon Detection**: Smart detection of statement-ending semicolons
- **Position Tracking**: Tracks start and end positions of each statement

## Testing

### Test Files

- **`test_execution_handler.py`**: Comprehensive testing UI for F5/F9 functionality
- **`demo_f5_f9.py`**: Demo script with sample data

### Running Tests

1. **Basic Tests** (command line):
   ```bash
   python test_execution_handler.py --test
   ```

2. **Interactive Test UI**:
   ```bash
   python test_execution_handler.py
   ```

3. **Full Demo with Sample Data**:
   ```bash
   python demo_f5_f9.py
   ```

## Integration Guide

### For Developers

To integrate F5/F9 functionality into an existing SQLEditor:

```python
from sqlshell.editor_integration import integrate_execution_functionality

# Integrate with your editor
integration = integrate_execution_functionality(
    your_editor, 
    execute_callback=your_execute_function
)

# The editor now supports F5/F9 automatically
```

### Custom Execution Callback

```python
def my_execute_callback(query_text):
    """Custom function to execute a SQL query."""
    # Your database execution logic here
    result = database.execute(query_text)
    # Handle result display
    display_results(result)

# Set the callback
integration.set_execute_callback(my_execute_callback)
```

## User Interface

### New UI Elements

1. **F5 - Execute All Button**: Executes all statements sequentially
2. **F9 - Execute Current Button**: Executes the statement at cursor position
3. **Enhanced Help Text**: Updated instructions showing F5/F9 usage

### Status Bar Messages

- `Statement executed: [query preview] | Time: 0.15s | Rows: 42`
- `Executed 4 statement(s)` (for F5)
- Clear indication of which functionality was used

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `F5` | Execute All | Run all SQL statements in the editor |
| `F9` | Execute Current | Run the statement containing the cursor |
| `Ctrl+Enter` | Execute Query | Run entire editor content (existing) |

## Error Handling

### Robust Error Management

- **Empty Statements**: Gracefully skips empty statements
- **Syntax Errors**: Shows clear error messages with statement context
- **Connection Issues**: Handles database connection problems
- **Parsing Errors**: Provides fallback behavior for complex SQL

### Error Messages

- Clear indication of which statement failed
- Preservation of original query text
- Non-blocking error handling (other statements can still execute)

## Best Practices

### Writing Multi-Statement SQL

1. **Use Clear Separation**: Always end statements with semicolons
2. **Add Comments**: Document what each statement does
3. **Test Incrementally**: Use F9 to test each statement individually
4. **Handle Dependencies**: Be aware of statement execution order for F5

### Example Best Practice
```sql
-- Step 1: Data preparation
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE employee_stats AS
SELECT department, COUNT(*) as count, AVG(salary) as avg_sal
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department;

-- Step 2: Analysis (depends on Step 1)
SELECT * FROM employee_stats 
WHERE avg_sal > 70000
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Step 3: Cleanup (always include cleanup)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employee_stats;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **F5/F9 Not Working**: Ensure the editor has focus and the integration is properly loaded
2. **Wrong Statement Executed**: Check cursor position; F9 executes the statement containing the cursor
3. **Parsing Issues**: Complex string literals with semicolons may need careful quoting

### Debug Information

Enable debug mode by running:
```bash
python test_execution_handler.py
```

This provides detailed parsing information and execution logs.

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- **Statement Highlighting**: Visual indication of which statement will be executed
- **Execution History**: Track and replay previously executed statements
- **Batch Execution Options**: More granular control over statement execution
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed timing and resource usage for each statement
