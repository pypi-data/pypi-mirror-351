## üìä Column Analysis

SQLShell provides powerful tools to analyze individual columns directly from your query results:

### Explain Column Feature

The "Explain Column" feature helps you understand the relationships between columns in your query results:

1. **How to Access**:
   - Right-click on any column header in the query results table
   - Select "Explain Column" from the context menu

2. **What It Does**:
   - Analyzes the selected column's relationship with other columns in the result set
   - Identifies correlations and dependencies between columns
   - Provides visualizations to help understand the column's importance and distribution

3. **Benefits**:
   - Quickly identify which columns are most related to your target column
   - Discover hidden patterns and relationships in your data
   - Make data-driven decisions without writing complex analytical queries

### Multivariate Analysis Feature

The Column Profiler now offers in-depth multivariate analysis to explore relationships between columns:

1. **How to Access**:
   - In the Column Profiler, double-click on any feature in the importance table
   - A detailed visualization window will appear showing the relationship between the selected feature and the target column

2. **Smart Visualizations**:
   - Automatically selects the most appropriate visualization based on data types:
     - **Numeric vs. Numeric**: Scatter plot with regression line
     - **Categorical vs. Numeric**: Bar chart showing average values
     - **Numeric vs. Categorical**: Box plot showing distribution
     - **Categorical vs. Categorical**: Heatmap showing relationship strength

3. **Benefits**:
   - Gain deeper insights into how features relate to your target variable
   - Understand which features have strong predictive relationships
   - Identify patterns and outliers in multivariate relationships
   - Make better decisions about feature selection for analysis and modeling

This feature is particularly useful for data scientists and analysts who need to understand variable relationships quickly without writing complex correlation queries.

### One-hot encoding

If you are working with text (i.e. job description or job title to analyze salary), you would want to 
do 'one-hot encoding'. 

1. **How to Access**:
   - Right-click on any column header in the query results table
   - Select "Encode text" from the context menu

<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oyvinrog/SQLShell/main/assets/images/column_encoding.png" alt="Column Profiler" width="80%" height="auto">
</div>

2. **How It Works**:
   - SQLShell tokenizes the text into meaningful words and phrases
   - Each unique token becomes a new binary feature (1 if present, 0 if absent)
   - The system applies intelligent filtering to remove common words with low information value
   - Results appear as a new query with encoded columns automatically added

<!-- Screenshot 2: Encoding process/dialog showing options -->

3. **Applications**:
   - Analyze how specific keywords in job descriptions correlate with salary levels
   - Identify which terms in product descriptions drive higher sales
   - Extract features from unstructured text for further analysis
   - Prepare text data for statistical modeling and machine learning

4. **Using the Encoded Data**:
   - After encoding, SQLShell presents a visualization showing top correlations
   - Sort encoded features by correlation strength to identify key terms
   - Use encoded columns in subsequent queries for deeper analysis
   - Join encoded results with other tables for cross-dataset insights

<!-- Screenshot 3: Results showing correlation between job descriptions and salary -->

5. **Benefits**:
   - Transform unstructured text into structured, analyzable data
   - Discover hidden patterns between text content and numerical outcomes
   - Identify specific terms that have the strongest relationship with target variables
   - Perform advanced text analysis without specialized NLP knowledge

This feature is particularly powerful for HR analytics, marketing text analysis, and any scenario where you need to extract insights from unstructured text data.
