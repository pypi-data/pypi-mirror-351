00:00:00,528 --> 00:00:06,328
A revolutionary athletic program is challenging everything we thought we knew about cats.

2
00:00:06,647 --> 00:00:07,508
Here's Brooke Landry.

3
00:00:08,653 --> 00:00:16,292
You might think a synchronized swimming team for cats sounds insane, but a brave team of trainers is trying to prove the skeptics wrong.

4
00:00:16,632 --> 00:00:21,682
They coach the Seattle Minanas, and I recently sat down with them to understand why.

5
00:00:22,181 --> 00:00:26,830
For me, it's all about the rush you get pull side watching these cats perform.

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,829
The training regimen is rigorous.

7
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:33,369
Six hours daily, no breaks, no excuses.

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,539
We we mostly coach with laser pointers, sometimes yarn. Um, a few are quite opinionated.

9
00:00:41,523 --> 00:00:43,593
But that might not be the whole story.

10
00:00:44,203 --> 00:00:52,000
An anonymous whistleblower claims the team has resorted to performance-enhancing drugs, including catnip injections.

11
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:55,432
Some rooms were off limits at the training compound.

12
00:00:56,883 --> 00:00:59,503
There are also questions about future funding.

13
00:00:59,802 --> 00:01:04,212
When we asked who was paying for all this, the team was hesitant to answer.

14
00:01:04,603 --> 00:01:10,433
A tech company pays for it, but uh, after all, after all the drownings, they won't let us use their name anymore.
