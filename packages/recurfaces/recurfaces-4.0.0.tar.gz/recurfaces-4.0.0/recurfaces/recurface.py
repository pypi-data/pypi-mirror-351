        in which they are stored within this property. If a recurface has no stored surface, its render pipeline
        will not be implemented during rendering.

        Flags should be enum values from PipelineFlag, and are used to determine at which point the
        child recurfaces should be applied to the surface, and also any points during the pipeline at which
        the surface should be cached.
        There must always be exactly one PipelineFlag.APPLY_CHILDREN flag present in this pipeline, but any
        number of PipelineFlag.CACHE_SURFACE flags (or none at all) can be present.

        Cached surfaces will prevent any steps before them in the pipeline from being re-run if they are unchanged,

        Filters can also be stored within this pipeline to apply last-minute changes to the working surface
        before it is rendered. These changes are not permanently applied to the stored surface, and will only be
        present on the rendered image as long as the filter is present in this recurface's pipeline.
        If a filter is flagged as not being 'deterministic' (i.e. always returns the same output when
        given the same input), the working surface cannot be cached after it in the pipeline - doing so would cause
        the rendered image not to update whenever the filter would produce a different output.

        Filters should never make modifications to recurfaces, only to the surface they are given;
