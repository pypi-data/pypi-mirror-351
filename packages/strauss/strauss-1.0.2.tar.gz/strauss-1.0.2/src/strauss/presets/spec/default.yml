description: >-
  Default preset for the synthesizer, using three saw wave oscillators,
  two of which are detuned slightly higher and lower respectively, with
  lower volumes. This gives a harmonically rich sound, suitable for
  filtering, with detuned unison saws removing some harshness.

    The `Spectraliser` generator type can be used to represent a frequency spectrum, by mapping
    any frequency range to an audible range, and generating a representative sound signal (using
    an [IFFT approach](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.fft.ifft.html)).
    In this approach, narrow spikes become tones at their frequency position, a sloped continuum
    becomes coloured noise, etc. _Note_: this generator must take a `spectrum` input, as an array,
    representing 'flux' or 'power' values of a spectrum, arranged from lowest to highest frequncy.

      Define the note volume envelope applied to the samples A,D,S & R correspond to 'attack',
      'decay', 'sustain' and 'release'. _'ADSR'_ is a common parametrisation in sound synthesis,
      Find out more e.g. [at this link]( https://learnmusicproduction.in/blogs/music-production-and-audio-engineering/adsr-fundamentals-in-music-everything-you-need-to-know).
    A: Attack, how long it takes for a sound to rise to 100% of the `level` after it’s triggered.
    D: Decay, how long it takes for the sounds volume to die down to the `Sustain` value after the `Attack` period.
    S: Sustain, the volume level (from 0 to 1.0) maintained after the `Decay` period, while the note is held.
    R: Release, how long the tone takes to finally die away once the note is released.
    Ac: Curvature of the attack portion of the envelope. Values from -1 to 1, positive indicates increases quickly then slow,
        negative slowly then quick. a value of 0 is a linear attack, increasing at a constant rate.
    Dc: Curvature of the Decay portion of the envelope. Values from -1 to 1, positive indicates decreases quickly then slow,
        negative slowly then quick. a value of 0 is a linear decay, decreasing at a constant rate.
    Rc: Curvature of the release portion of the envelope. Values from -1 to 1, positive indicates decreases quickly then slow,
        negative slowly then quick. a value of 0 is a linear release, decreasing at a constant rate.
    level: Total amplitude level of the envelope from 0 to 1, contolling maximum volume of the note.
  filter: >-
    Do we apply a frequency filter to the audio signal? This can be used to change the balance of frequencies and manipulate
    the 'timbre' of a note
  filter_type: >-
    Choose from available filter types 
  cutoff: >-
    The cut-off frequency (or 'knee') of the filter, at which frequencies are attenuated beyond.

    S: Sustain, the LFO depth (from 0 to 1.0) maintained after the `Decay` period, while the note is held.
    R: Release, how long LFO depth takes to finally die to 0 once the note is released.
    Ac: Curvature of the attack portion of the envelope. Values from -1 to 1, positive indicates increases quickly then slow,
        negative slowly then quick. a value of 0 is a linear attack, increasing at a constant rate.
