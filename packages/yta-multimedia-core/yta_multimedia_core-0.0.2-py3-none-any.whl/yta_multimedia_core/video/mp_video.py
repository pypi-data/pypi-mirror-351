"""
This video is outdated and almost deprecated due
to the new VideoWrapped class that includes the
main functionality we wanted here, but I still
preserve this code because there is something
else that I need to add but in other libraries.

The main reason of this class was recalculating
the video duration based on the frames that 
actually existed, iterating over them until we
found an Exception and detected the last valid
frame, adjusting the duration according to that
last frame. But there are some other additional
functionalities that are more complex and must
be in more advanced libraries.
