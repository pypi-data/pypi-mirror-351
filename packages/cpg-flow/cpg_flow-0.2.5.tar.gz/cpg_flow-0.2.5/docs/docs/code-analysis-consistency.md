# üîç Code Linting and Formatting

![Precommit](https://img.shields.io/badge/pre--commit-enabled-brightgreen?logo=pre-commit&logoColor=white)

In order to keep the code clean, consistent and free of bad python practices, more than **Over 10 pre-commit hooks are enabled** !

Complete list of all enabled rules is available in the **[.pre-commit-config.yaml file](https://github.com/populationgenomics/cpg-flow/blob/main/.pre-commit-config.yaml)**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

!!! info
    Before linting, you must follow the [installation steps](installation.md#installation).

Then, run the following command

```bash
# Lint
pre-commit run --all-files
```

When setting up local linting for development you can also run the following once:

```bash
# Install the pre-commit hook
pre-commit install

# Or equivalently
make init || make init-dev
```

## ü•á Project quality scanner

Multiple tools are set up to maintain the best code quality and to prevent vulnerabilities:
