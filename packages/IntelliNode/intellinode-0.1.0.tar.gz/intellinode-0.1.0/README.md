# üß† PerceptronLib: A Flexible Perceptron Model in Pure Python

**PerceptronLib** is a Python library that implements a fully functional perceptron from scratch ‚Äî supporting **linear regression**, **binary classification**, and **multi-class classification** ‚Äî all without relying on machine learning libraries like scikit-learn or PyTorch for the core logic.

---

## üöÄ Features

* ‚úÖ Train a perceptron for **regression**, **binary**, or **multi-class classification**
* ‚úÖ Implements **custom gradient descent** with proper loss functions:

  * MSE (Linear)
  * Binary Cross-Entropy (Binary)
  * Log Loss with Softmax (Multi-class)
* ‚úÖ Includes **data scaling enforcement** (standard or min-max scaled)
* ‚úÖ Automatically detects problem type from the dataset
* ‚úÖ Custom `predict()` and internal `score()` method (optional)
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Includes warnings when using a single-layer perceptron on unsuitable tasks

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install IntelliNode
```

---

## ü•™ Quickstart

```python
from IntelliNode.PerceptronX import Perceptron
import pandas as pd

# Load or create your DataFrame (last column = target)
df = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")

model = Perceptron()
model.fit(df)
predictions = model.predict(df.iloc[:, :-1])
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Scaling Required

All input features **must be either Standard Scaled or Min-Max Scaled**:

* Use `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` or
* Use the helper `s_scaler_fn()` or `m_scaler_fn()` defined in the code

### Resume Entry

#### üß† Perceptron Model Library ‚Äî Python (2025)

**Built a complete perceptron library from scratch** to handle regression, binary, and multi-class classification problems using custom gradient descent algorithms.

* Implemented MSE, Binary Cross-Entropy, and Softmax Log Loss from first principles.
* Added automatic detection of problem type, input validation, and warning systems for misuse.
* Enforced preprocessing standards (standard or min-max scaling) before training.
* Designed `fit()` and `predict()` APIs to mimic real-world ML libraries and structured code for reuse and publication.

### Portfolio Website Description
