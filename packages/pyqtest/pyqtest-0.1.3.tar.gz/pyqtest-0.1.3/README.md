# PyQtest

PyQtest is a very small module for developing Qt widgets in TDD (or just testing). The idea is as follows. The usual unit tests are written, in which the widget under test is brought to a certain state and displayed in a special window. The user is asked a question (assert), after which he must press one the buttons "yes" or "no".
