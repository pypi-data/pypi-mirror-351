## add implementation to handle better both the cases of various spellings of M 
## and the handling of the cases of words ending with H --- 
## some dictionaries match entries with the nominative having a final H
## some keep the vocative that has no H
## there should be a map 
## if --- word ends with H 
## keep it in some dictionaries 
## and trim for others
## on the reverse 
## if the word ends with a vowel and the dictionary is one of those that search for H
## in that case add an H before the search
