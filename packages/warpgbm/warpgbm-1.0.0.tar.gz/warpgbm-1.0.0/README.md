# WarpGBM

WarpGBM is a high-performance, GPU-accelerated Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT) library built with PyTorch and CUDA. It offers blazing-fast histogram-based training and efficient prediction, with compatibility for research and production workflows.

**New in v1.0.0:** WarpGBM introduces *Invariant Gradient Boosting* â€” a powerful approach to learning signals that remain stable across shifting environments (e.g., time, regimes, or datasets). Powered by a novel algorithm called **[Directional Era-Splitting (DES)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14496)**, WarpGBM doesn't just train faster than other leading GBDT libraries â€” it trains smarter.

If your data evolves over time, WarpGBM is the only GBDT library designed to *adapt and generalize*.

## Features

- **Blazing-fast GPU training** with custom CUDA kernels for binning, histogram building, split finding, and prediction
- **Invariant signal learning** via [Directional Era-Splitting (DES)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14496) â€” designed for datasets with shifting environments (e.g., time, regimes, experimental settings)
- Drop-in **scikit-learn style interface** for easy adoption
- Supports **pre-binned data** or **automatic quantile binning**
- Works with `float32` or `int8` inputs

## Benchmarks

### Scikit-Learn Synthetic Data: 1 Million Rows and 1,000 Features

In this benchmark we compare the speed and in-sample correlation of **WarpGBM v0.1.21** against LightGBM, XGBoost and CatBoost, all with their GPU-enabled versions. This benchmark runs on Google Colab with the L4 GPU environment.

```
   WarpGBM:   corr = 0.8882, train = 18.7s, infer = 4.9s
   XGBoost:   corr = 0.8877, train = 33.1s, infer = 8.1s
  LightGBM:   corr = 0.8604, train = 30.3s, infer = 1.4s
  CatBoost:   corr = 0.8935, train = 400.0s, infer = 382.6s
```

## Installation

### Recommended (GitHub, always latest):

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/jefferythewind/warpgbm.git
```

This installs the latest version directly from GitHub and compiles CUDA extensions on your machine using your **local PyTorch and CUDA setup**. It's the most reliable method for ensuring compatibility and staying up to date with the latest features.

### Alternatively (PyPI, stable releases):

```bash
pip install warpgbm
```

This installs from PyPI and also compiles CUDA code locally during installation. This method works well **if your environment already has PyTorch with GPU support** installed and configured.

> **Tip:**\
> If you encounter an error related to mismatched or missing CUDA versions, try installing with the following flag. This is currently required in the Colab environments.
>
> ```bash
> pip install warpgbm --no-build-isolation
> ```

### Windows

Thank you, ShatteredX, for providing working instructions for a Windows installation.

```
git clone https://github.com/jefferythewind/warpgbm.git
cd warpgbm
python setup.py bdist_wheel
pip install .\dist\warpgbm-0.1.15-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl
```

Before either method, make sure youâ€™ve installed PyTorch with GPU support:\

## Learning Invariant Signals Across Environments

Most supervised learning models rely on an assumption known as the **Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM)** principle. Under ERM, the data distribution connecting inputs \( X \) and targets \( Y \) is assumed to be **fixed** and **stationary** across training, validation, and test splits. That is:

> The patterns you learn from the training set are expected to generalize out-of-sample â€” *as long as the test data follows the same distribution as the training data.*

However, this assumption is often violated in real-world settings. Data frequently shifts across time, geography, experimental conditions, or other hidden factors. This phenomenon is known as **distribution shift**, and it leads to models that perform well in-sample but fail catastrophically out-of-sample.

This challenge motivates the field of **Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Generalization**, which assumes your data is drawn from **distinct environments or eras** â€” e.g., time periods, customer segments, experimental trials. Some signals may appear predictive within specific environments but vanish or reverse in others. These are called **spurious signals**. On the other hand, signals that remain consistently predictive across all environments are called **invariant signals**.

WarpGBM v1.0.0 introduces **Directional Era-Splitting (DES)**, a new algorithm designed to identify and learn from invariant signals â€” ignoring signals that fail to generalize across environments.

---

### Why This Matters

- Standard models trained via ERM can learn to exploit **spurious correlations** that only hold in some parts of the data.
- DES explicitly tests whether a feature's split is **directionally consistent** across all eras â€” only such *invariant splits* are kept.
- This approach has been shown to reduce overfitting and improve out-of-sample generalization, particularly in financial and scientific datasets.

---

### Visual Intuition

We contrast two views of the data:

- **ERM Setting**: All data is assumed to come from the same source (single distribution).\
  No awareness of environments â€” spurious signals can dominate.

- **OOD Setting (Era-Splitting)**: Data is explicitly grouped by environment (era).\
  The model checks whether a signal holds across all groups â€” enforcing **robustness**.

WarpGBM is the **first open-source GBDT framework to integrate this OOD-aware approach natively**, using efficient CUDA kernels to evaluate per-era consistency during tree growth. Itâ€™s not just faster â€” itâ€™s smarter.

### Quick Comparison with LightGBM CPU version

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
from time import time
import lightgbm as lgb
from warpgbm import WarpGBM

# Create synthetic regression dataset
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100_000, n_features=500, noise=0.1, random_state=42)
X = X.astype(np.float32)
y = y.astype(np.float32)

# Train LightGBM
start = time()
lgb_model = lgb.LGBMRegressor(max_depth=5, n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.01, max_bin=7)
lgb_model.fit(X, y)
lgb_time = time() - start
lgb_preds = lgb_model.predict(X)

# Train WarpGBM
start = time()
wgbm_model = WarpGBM(max_depth=5, n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.01, num_bins=7)
wgbm_model.fit(X, y)
wgbm_time = time() - start
wgbm_preds = wgbm_model.predict(X)

# Results
print(f"LightGBM:   corr = {np.corrcoef(lgb_preds, y)[0,1]:.4f}, time = {lgb_time:.2f}s")
print(f"WarpGBM:     corr = {np.corrcoef(wgbm_preds, y)[0,1]:.4f}, time = {wgbm_time:.2f}s")
```

**Results (Ryzen 9 CPU, NVIDIA 3090 GPU):**

```
LightGBM:   corr = 0.8742, time = 37.33s
WarpGBM:     corr = 0.8621, time = 5.40s
```

### Pre-binned Data Example (Numerai)

WarpGBM can save additional training time if your dataset is already pre-binned. The Numerai tournament data is a great example:

```python
import pandas as pd
from numerapi import NumerAPI
from time import time
import lightgbm as lgb
from warpgbm import WarpGBM
import numpy as np

napi = NumerAPI()
napi.download_dataset('v5.0/train.parquet', 'train.parquet')
train = pd.read_parquet('train.parquet')

feature_set = [f for f in train.columns if 'feature' in f]
target = 'target_cyrus'

X_np = train[feature_set].astype('int8').values
Y_np = train[target].values

# LightGBM
start = time()
lgb_model = lgb.LGBMRegressor(max_depth=5, n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.01, max_bin=7)
lgb_model.fit(X_np, Y_np)
lgb_time = time() - start
lgb_preds = lgb_model.predict(X_np)

# WarpGBM
start = time()
wgbm_model = WarpGBM(max_depth=5, n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.01, num_bins=7)
wgbm_model.fit(X_np, Y_np)
wgbm_time = time() - start
wgbm_preds = wgbm_model.predict(X_np)

# Results
print(f"LightGBM:   corr = {np.corrcoef(lgb_preds, Y_np)[0,1]:.4f}, time = {lgb_time:.2f}s")
print(f"WarpGBM:     corr = {np.corrcoef(wgbm_preds, Y_np)[0,1]:.4f}, time = {wgbm_time:.2f}s")
```

**Results (Google Colab Pro, A100 GPU):**

```
LightGBM:   corr = 0.0703, time = 643.88s
WarpGBM:     corr = 0.0660, time = 49.16s
```
