# Dependency Security Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing the security of dependencies in the openssl_encrypt project. It builds upon the findings from the dependency inventory and critical dependencies assessment.

## Phase 1: Immediate Security Updates (1 week)

### 1.1 Update Critical Dependencies

- **Update cryptography package**
  - Change version requirement from `>=42.0.0,<43.0.0` to `>=44.0.1,<45.0.0` in both requirements.txt and setup.py
  - Update any code that might be affected by API changes in the newer version
  - Test thoroughly to ensure compatibility

### 1.2 Improve Version Pinning

- **Add constraints to loosely pinned dependencies**
  - Add upper version bounds to PyYAML: `PyYAML>=6.0.2,<7.0.0`
  - Add version constraints to whirlpool-py311: `whirlpool-py311>=1.0.0,<2.0.0`
  - Ensure all security-critical dependencies have both lower and upper bounds

### 1.3 Document Changes

- **Update documentation**
  - Document the security improvements made
  - Note the rationale for version constraints
  - Create a changelog entry describing security updates

#### Implementation Notes

The following changes have been implemented:

1. **Critical Security Updates**:
   - Updated `cryptography` from `>=42.0.0,<43.0.0` to `>=44.0.1,<45.0.0` to address CVE-2024-12797
   - This security vulnerability related to AES-OCB mode key reuse which could lead to a nonce-reuse attack

2. **Version Constraint Improvements**:
   - Added upper version bounds to `PyYAML`: `>=6.0.2,<7.0.0`
   - Added specific version constraints to `whirlpool-py311`: `>=1.0.0,<2.0.0`
   - Added `bcrypt~=4.3.0` with compatible release specifier
   - Updated development dependencies with upper bounds:
     - `pytest>=8.0.0,<9.0.0`
     - `pytest-cov>=4.1.0,<5.0.0`
     - `black>=24.1.0,<25.0.0`
     - `pylint>=3.0.0,<4.0.0`
     
3. **Files Updated**:
   - `requirements.txt`: Updated all dependencies with proper version constraints
   - `setup.py`: Synchronized version constraints with requirements.txt

These changes follow the approach of allowing patch updates (which typically contain security fixes) while preventing unexpected major or minor version updates that might introduce breaking changes.

## Phase 2: Dependency Pinning Strategy (1-2 weeks)

### 2.1 Implement Lock Files

- **Create pip-compile setup**
  - Install pip-tools
  - Create separate requirement files for different environments
    - requirements-dev.in (development dependencies)
    - requirements-prod.in (production dependencies)
  - Generate lock files using pip-compile
    - requirements-dev.txt
    - requirements-prod.txt

#### Implementation Notes

The following has been implemented:

1. **Lock File Creation**:
   - Created `requirements-prod.in` and `requirements-dev.in` source files
   - Generated precise lock files with `pip-compile`
   - Integrated lock files with setup.py

2. **Dependency Update Workflow**:
   - Added `scripts/update_dependencies.sh` for easy dependency updates
   - Created documentation for the dependency management process

3. **Reproducible Builds**:
   - Lock files ensure exact versions for reproducible builds
   - Explicit dependencies for development vs. production environments

### 2.2 Create Version Pinning Policy

- **Document version pinning approach**
  - Define strategy for semantic versioning constraints
  - Create guidelines for when to use exact pinning (`==`) vs. compatible releases (`~=`) vs. minor updates (`>=x.y.z,<x.y+1.0`)
  - Document procedure for exception handling (when strict pinning might be relaxed)

#### Implementation Notes

The following has been implemented:

1. **Version Pinning Policy Document**:
   - Created VERSION_PINNING_POLICY.md with comprehensive guidelines
   - Defined specific approaches for different dependency types
   - Documented when to use each version specifier

2. **Categorization of Dependencies**:
   - Security-critical dependencies: Strict bounds (e.g., `cryptography>=44.0.1,<45.0.0`)
   - Standard dependencies: Compatible release specifier (e.g., `bcrypt~=4.3.0`)
   - Development dependencies: Major version cap (e.g., `pytest>=8.0.0,<9.0.0`)
   - Platform-specific dependencies: Environment markers with appropriate constraints

3. **Exception Handling Process**:
   - Established criteria for exceptions to the policy
   - Defined process for documenting and approving exceptions
   - Set up verification methods to ensure compliance

### 2.3 Set Up Dependency Update Workflow

- **Create dependency update process**
  - Document step-by-step guide for updating dependencies
  - Define schedule for regular updates (e.g., monthly)
  - Create template for dependency update PRs

## Phase 3: Automated Security Scanning (1-2 weeks)

### 3.1 Local Development Scanning

- **Implement pre-commit hooks**
  - Add safety or similar tool as a pre-commit hook
  - Configure to block commits with known vulnerable dependencies
