# Security Improvements

This document tracks security improvements that have been identified and implemented in the openssl_encrypt library.

## Completed Improvements

### 1. Fixed XChaCha20Poly1305 nonce truncation issue
- ✅ Properly handling 24-byte nonces for XChaCha20Poly1305
- ✅ Maintaining backward compatibility with existing encrypted files

### 2. Standardized nonce generation across all algorithms
- ✅ Implemented consistent nonce generation for all algorithms
- ✅ Ensured proper nonce sizes for each algorithm
- ✅ Added validation to prevent weak or predictable nonces

### 3. Fixed salt reuse issues in key derivation
- ✅ Modified PBKDF2 implementation to use unique salts for each iteration
- ✅ Ensured salts are securely generated using strong random sources
- ✅ Properly zeroing out sensitive salt data with secure_memzero()

### 4. Removed debug outputs of key material
- ✅ Removed or masked debug output in pqc.py
- ✅ Removed sensitive data output in unittests.py
- ✅ Ensured no key material is logged in any environment

### 5. Implemented constant-time MAC comparison across all modes
- ✅ Verified that constant_time_compare is already properly implemented
- ✅ Used for HMAC verification in CamelliaCipher (crypt_core.py line ~437)
- ✅ Used for hash verification in decrypt_file (crypt_core.py lines ~1977 and ~2269)
- ✅ No other instances of direct MAC comparison were found in the codebase

## Pending Improvements

### 1. Fix potential timing side channels in Camellia implementation

### 2. Implement stronger password policies

### 3. Implement secure key storage
