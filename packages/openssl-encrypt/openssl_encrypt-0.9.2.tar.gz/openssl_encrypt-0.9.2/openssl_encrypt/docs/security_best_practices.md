## General Security Principles

These fundamental principles should guide your security practices:

### Defense in Depth

Never rely on a single security measure. Instead, implement multiple layers of security:

```python
# Example: Using multiple security layers
from openssl_encrypt.modules import crypt_core, pqc
from openssl_encrypt.modules.password_policy import PasswordPolicy

# Layer 1: Enforce strong password policy
policy = PasswordPolicy(policy_level="paranoid")
policy.validate_password(password)

# Layer 2: Use authenticated encryption
encrypted_data = crypt_core.encrypt_file(
    input_file, output_file, password, encryption_data="aes-gcm"
)

# Layer 3: Apply post-quantum protection (if needed)
if high_security_required:
    encrypted_data = pqc.encrypt_file(
        input_file, output_file, password, pqc_algorithm="ML-KEM-768"
    )
```

### Principle of Least Privilege

Only grant the minimum permissions necessary:

```python
# Example: Apply restrictive file permissions
import os

# Set read-only for owner only (0400) for sensitive files
os.chmod("/path/to/encryption_key", 0o400)
```

### Keep It Simple

Simplicity enhances security by reducing the potential for errors:

```python
# Good: Simple and secure approach
from openssl_encrypt import crypt_core

crypt_core.encrypt_file(input_file, output_file, password)

# Bad: Unnecessary complexity increases risk
# Custom implementation with manual IV handling, custom algorithms, etc.
```

### Assume Breach

Design your security with the assumption that other safeguards might fail:

- Encrypt sensitive data even on encrypted drives
- Use multi-factor authentication for accessing encryption keys
- Implement security monitoring for detection of unauthorized access

## Password Management

Proper password management is essential for the security of your encrypted data:

### Creating Strong Passwords

#### Password Strength Guidelines

1. **Length**: Use passwords with a minimum of 16 characters when possible
2. **Complexity**: Include a mix of:
   - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
   - Lowercase letters (a-z)
   - Numbers (0-9)
   - Special characters (!@#$%^&*)
3. **Unpredictability**: Avoid predictable patterns or personal information

```python
# Example: Checking password strength
from openssl_encrypt.modules.password_policy import PasswordPolicy
from openssl_encrypt.modules.crypt_core import string_entropy

# Create a policy with strong requirements
policy = PasswordPolicy(
    min_length=16,
    require_lowercase=True,
    require_uppercase=True,
    require_digits=True,
    require_special=True,
    min_entropy=100.0,  # Very strong entropy requirement
    check_common_passwords=True
)

# Validate a password against the policy
try:
    policy.validate_password("YourPassword123!")
    print("Password meets security requirements")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Password is not secure: {str(e)}")
    
# Check password entropy directly
entropy = string_entropy("YourPassword123!")
print(f"Password entropy: {entropy} bits")
```

#### Using Passphrases

Consider using passphrases instead of passwords:

- Longer and easier to remember
- Higher entropy due to length
- Less susceptible to brute force attacks

Example passphrase: `correct-horse-battery-staple-7$`

### Password Storage Recommendations

1. **Use a Password Manager**:
   - Store encryption passwords in a reputable password manager
   - Generate unique passwords for different encrypted files
   - Ensure the password manager itself has a strong master password

2. **Avoid Plaintext Storage**:
   - Never store passwords in plaintext files
   - Do not include passwords in scripts or source code
   - Be careful with environment variables that contain passwords

3. **Physical Storage (if necessary)**:
   - If written down, store in a secure, locked location
   - Consider splitting passwords across multiple physical locations
   - Use a cipher or transformation known only to you

### Password Rotation

1. **Regular Updates**:
   - Change encryption passwords periodically
   - Immediately rotate passwords after suspected compromise
   - Update passwords when team members change roles

2. **Re-encryption Process**:
   ```python
   # Example: Rotating passwords (re-encrypting with a new password)
   from openssl_encrypt import crypt_core
   
   # Step 1: Decrypt with old password
   crypt_core.decrypt_file(
       "encrypted_file.dat", 
       "temp_decrypted.dat", 
       old_password
   )
   
   # Step 2: Re-encrypt with new password
   crypt_core.encrypt_file(
       "temp_decrypted.dat", 
       "new_encrypted_file.dat", 
       new_password
   )
   
   # Step 3: Securely delete the temporary file
   crypt_core.secure_delete_file("temp_decrypted.dat")
   ```

## Key Management

Proper key management is critical for maintaining encryption security:

### Key Generation

1. **Using the Library's Key Generation**:
   ```python
   from openssl_encrypt.modules.crypto_secure_memory import generate_secure_key
   
   # Generate a secure cryptographic key (256 bits)
   key = generate_secure_key(32)
   ```

2. **Key Derivation from Passwords**:
   ```python
   from openssl_encrypt.modules.crypto_secure_memory import create_key_from_password
   import os
   
   # Generate a random salt
   salt = os.urandom(16)
   
   # Derive a key from a password with strong parameters
   key = create_key_from_password(
       password="your-strong-password",
       salt=salt,
       key_size=32,  # 256 bits
       hash_iterations=100000  # High iteration count for security
   )
   ```

### Secure Key Storage

1. **Using the Keystore**:
   ```python
   from openssl_encrypt.modules.keystore_wrapper import KeyStore
   
   # Initialize keystore with a strong master password
   keystore = KeyStore("/path/to/keystore.db", "master-password")
   
   # Store a key with a descriptive identifier
   keystore.store_key("project-x-encryption", key_data)
   
   # Retrieve a key when needed
   key_data = keystore.get_key("project-x-encryption")
   ```

2. **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)**:
   - Use HSMs for high-security environments when available
   - Keep encryption keys in specialized hardware that prevents extraction
   - Follow HSM vendor guidelines for secure initialization and operation

3. **Secure Enclaves and TPMs**:
   - On systems with TPM modules, consider binding keys to the TPM
   - Use platform-specific secure enclaves where available (e.g., SGX)

### Key Backup and Recovery

1. **Secure Backup Procedures**:
   - Encrypt key backups with a different mechanism than the primary keys
   - Store backups in physically separate locations
   - Use multi-factor authentication for backup access

2. **Key Recovery Planning**:
   - Document secure recovery procedures for authorized personnel
   - Test recovery processes regularly to ensure functionality
   - Consider key splitting/sharing for critical keys

3. **Key Escrow Considerations**:
   - For organizational use, consider a secure key escrow system
   - Ensure escrow procedures include strict access controls
   - Document legal and compliance requirements for key escrow

### Key Rotation Practices

1. **Scheduled Rotation**:
   - Rotate encryption keys on a regular schedule
   - More frequent rotation for higher-value data
   - Consider automated rotation where possible

2. **Rotation Implementation**:
   ```python
   from openssl_encrypt.modules.keystore_wrapper import KeyStore
   from openssl_encrypt.modules.crypto_secure_memory import generate_secure_key
   
   # Initialize keystore
   keystore = KeyStore("/path/to/keystore.db", "master-password")
   
   # Generate a new key
   new_key = generate_secure_key(32)
   
   # Store the new key with a versioned identifier
   keystore.store_key("project-x-encryption-v2", new_key)
   
   # Re-encrypt data with the new key
   # (implementation depends on your specific use case)
   ```

## Algorithm Selection

Choosing the right encryption algorithms is essential for security:

### Recommended Algorithms

| Use Case | Recommended Algorithm | Alternative |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| General Data Encryption | AES-GCM (256-bit) | ChaCha20-Poly1305 |
| Nonce Reuse Risk | AES-GCM-SIV | XChaCha20-Poly1305 |
| Memory-Constrained Devices | ChaCha20-Poly1305 | AES-GCM |
| Post-Quantum Protection | ML-KEM-768 + AES-GCM | ML-KEM-1024 + ChaCha20-Poly1305 |
| Long-term Data Storage | Hybrid PQ Encryption | Multiple Algorithm Layers |

### Algorithm Selection Examples

```python
# Standard secure encryption (AES-GCM)
crypt_core.encrypt_file(input_file, output_file, password, encryption_data="aes-gcm")

# For systems without AES hardware acceleration
crypt_core.encrypt_file(input_file, output_file, password, encryption_data="chacha20-poly1305")

# When nonce uniqueness can't be guaranteed
crypt_core.encrypt_file(input_file, output_file, password, encryption_data="aes-gcm-siv")

# For data that needs long-term protection (post-quantum)
crypt_core.encrypt_file(
    input_file, output_file, password, 
    encryption_data="aes-gcm", pqc_algorithm="ML-KEM-768"
)
```

### Avoiding Deprecated Algorithms

The library will warn about deprecated algorithms, but you should proactively avoid:

- Legacy ciphers like Camellia
- Non-AEAD modes like AES-CBC without proper authentication
- Any algorithm marked as DEPRECATED or UNSAFE by the library

```python
from openssl_encrypt.modules.algorithm_warnings import is_deprecated, get_recommended_replacement

# Check if an algorithm is deprecated before using
algorithm = "Kyber512"
if is_deprecated(algorithm):
    replacement = get_recommended_replacement(algorithm)
    print(f"Warning: {algorithm} is deprecated. Use {replacement} instead.")
```

## Post-Quantum Security

Protecting data against future quantum computers:

### When to Use Post-Quantum Encryption

Consider post-quantum encryption for:
- Data that must remain confidential for 10+ years
- Information subject to "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks
- Highly sensitive data requiring maximum security
- Compliance with forward-looking security standards

### Recommended Post-Quantum Settings

```python
# Balanced security (NIST Level 3 / AES-192 equivalent)
crypt_core.encrypt_file(
    input_file, output_file, password,
    encryption_data="aes-gcm",
    pqc_algorithm="ML-KEM-768"  # ML-KEM-768 = Kyber768 (NIST standardized name)
)

# Maximum security (NIST Level 5 / AES-256 equivalent)
crypt_core.encrypt_file(
    input_file, output_file, password,
    encryption_data="aes-gcm",
    pqc_algorithm="ML-KEM-1024"  # ML-KEM-1024 = Kyber1024 (NIST standardized name)
)

# Using multiple PQ algorithm families for algorithm diversity
# This requires additional code to implement multi-layer encryption
```

### Migration Strategy

For existing encrypted data:

1. **Inventory Existing Encryption**: Document all encrypted data assets
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate quantum risk based on data sensitivity and lifetime
3. **Prioritized Migration**: Focus on highest-risk assets first
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Use hybrid classical/PQ encryption during transition
5. **Monitoring**: Stay informed about developments in quantum computing

## Environment Security

Securing the environment where encryption operations occur:

### Memory Protection

1. **Minimize Memory Exposure**:
   ```python
   # Use secure memory containers for sensitive data
   from openssl_encrypt.modules.secure_memory import secure_buffer
   
   # This ensures data is securely wiped when no longer needed
   with secure_buffer(size=1024) as buffer:
       # Use buffer for sensitive operations
       buffer.extend(sensitive_data)
       process_sensitive_data(buffer)
       # Data is automatically wiped after the context ends
   ```

2. **Avoid Core Dumps**:
   ```python
   import resource
   
   # Disable core dumps to prevent memory exposure
   resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_CORE, (0, 0))
   ```

### Operating System Security

1. **Disk Encryption**: Use full-disk encryption in addition to file encryption
2. **Access Controls**: Implement strict file permissions and access controls
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep systems patched with security updates
4. **Minimal Services**: Run only necessary services to reduce attack surface

### Secure Deployment

1. **Dependency Management**:
   ```python
   # Pin dependencies to specific versions
   # requirements.txt
   openssl_encrypt==2.1.3
   cryptography==42.0.1
   ```

2. **Configuration Validation**:
   ```python
   # Validate security configurations before deployment
   from openssl_encrypt.modules.crypt_settings import validate_security_config
   
   # Throws an exception if the configuration is insecure
   validate_security_config(config_dict)
   ```

3. **Secure Defaults**: Rely on the library's secure defaults unless you have specific reasons to change them

## Secure File Handling

Best practices for handling encrypted files:

### File Naming and Storage

1. **Non-Revealing Names**: Avoid filenames that reveal contents
2. **Consistent Organization**: Organize encrypted files systematically
3. **Metadata Caution**: Be aware that metadata might reveal sensitive information

### Secure Deletion

Always use secure deletion methods when removing sensitive files:

```python
from openssl_encrypt.modules.crypt_core import secure_delete_file

# Standard secure deletion
secure_delete_file("/path/to/sensitive-file.txt")

# Extra-secure deletion for highly sensitive data
secure_delete_file("/path/to/top-secret.txt", passes=7)
```

### File Integrity Verification

Verify file integrity after encryption/decryption operations:

```python
from openssl_encrypt.modules.crypt_core import verify_file_integrity

# Verify that a file has not been tampered with
is_valid = verify_file_integrity(
    "/path/to/encrypted-file.dat",
    expected_hash="sha256:1234abcd..."  # Previously stored hash
)

if not is_valid:
    print("WARNING: File may have been tampered with!")
```

## Testing and Verification

Regular testing is essential for security:

### Encryption Verification

1. **Roundtrip Testing**:
   ```python
   # Test encryption and decryption in a single operation
   from openssl_encrypt.modules.crypt_core import test_roundtrip
   
   # Verify that encryption+decryption returns the original data
   success = test_roundtrip(
       test_data=b"Test data to encrypt and decrypt",
       password="test-password",
       encryption_data="aes-gcm"
   )
   
   assert success, "Roundtrip test failed!"
   ```

2. **Key Derivation Testing**:
   ```python
   # Verify that key derivation is consistent
   from openssl_encrypt.modules.crypto_secure_memory import create_key_from_password
   
   # Same password and salt should produce the same key
   key1 = create_key_from_password("test-password", b"salt", 32)
   key2 = create_key_from_password("test-password", b"salt", 32)
   
   assert key1.get_bytes() == key2.get_bytes(), "Key derivation inconsistency detected!"
   ```

### Security Testing

1. **Regular Security Audits**:
   - Perform security reviews of your encryption implementation
   - Verify compliance with security policies
   - Check for algorithm deprecation warnings

2. **Penetration Testing**:
   - Test your encrypted systems against realistic attacks
   - Simulate attacker behavior to identify weaknesses
   - Address any findings promptly

## Operational Security

Security practices for day-to-day operations:

### Logging and Monitoring

1. **Security Event Logging**:
   ```python
   import logging
   
   # Configure logging (but never log sensitive data)
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
   logger = logging.getLogger("encryption-service")
   
   # Log security events (without sensitive details)
   logger.info("Encryption operation completed for file: %s", file_id)
   logger.warning("Failed decryption attempt for file: %s", file_id)
   ```

2. **Audit Trail**:
   - Maintain records of encryption/decryption operations
   - Track access to encryption keys
   - Monitor for unusual patterns or unauthorized access attempts

### Access Control

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**:
   - Grant minimal necessary access to encryption tools
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Regularly review and revoke unnecessary access

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication**:
   - Require MFA for access to encryption keys
   - Use hardware security keys when possible
   - Implement separate authentication for critical operations

### Secure Communication

1. **TLS for All Communications**:
   - Use TLS 1.3 when available
   - Configure secure cipher suites
   - Validate certificates properly

2. **Secure Key Exchange**:
   - Use secure channels for password/key transmission
   - Consider out-of-band methods for sharing secrets
   - Avoid sending keys through unencrypted channels

## Recovery Planning

Prepare for security incidents and recovery scenarios:

### Backup Strategies

1. **Encrypted Backups**:
   ```python
   from openssl_encrypt.modules.crypt_core import encrypt_file
   import shutil
   
   # Create an encrypted backup
   def create_encrypted_backup(source_file, backup_dir, password):
       backup_path = f"{backup_dir}/{os.path.basename(source_file)}.backup.enc"
       encrypt_file(source_file, backup_path, password)
       return backup_path
   ```

2. **Key Backup**:
   - Store backup copies of encryption keys securely
   - Consider key splitting across multiple secure locations
   - Document recovery procedures clearly

### Recovery Testing

1. **Regular Drills**:
   - Practice recovery procedures regularly
   - Verify that backups can be successfully restored
   - Train staff on emergency procedures

2. **Documentation**:
   - Maintain clear, accessible recovery documentation
   - Store documentation securely but make it available when needed
   - Include contact information for security personnel

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Be aware of these common security pitfalls:

### Implementation Errors

1. **Hardcoded Secrets**:
   ```python
   # BAD: Hardcoded password in source code
   encrypt_file(input_file, output_file, "hardcoded-password")
   
   # GOOD: Load from secure source
   from secure_config import load_secret
   password = load_secret("encryption_password")
   encrypt_file(input_file, output_file, password)
   ```

2. **Insecure Randomness**:
   ```python
   # BAD: Using weak randomness
   import random
   iv = bytes([random.randint(0, 255) for _ in range(16)])
   
   # GOOD: Using cryptographic randomness
   import secrets
   iv = secrets.token_bytes(16)
   ```

3. **DIY Cryptography**:
   ```python
   # BAD: Custom encryption implementation
   def my_custom_encryption(data, key):
       # Insecure custom implementation...
   
   # GOOD: Use the library's well-tested implementations
   from openssl_encrypt.modules.crypt_core import encrypt_data
   encrypted = encrypt_data(data, key, "aes-gcm")
   ```

### Operational Mistakes

1. **Neglecting Key Rotation**:
   - Failure to rotate keys on schedule
   - Using the same key for too many different purposes
   - Not updating keys after personnel changes

2. **Improper Error Handling**:
   ```python
   # BAD: Revealing error details
   try:
       decrypt_file(input_file, output_file, password)
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"Detailed error: {str(e)}")  # Might leak information
   
   # GOOD: Generic error messages
   try:
       decrypt_file(input_file, output_file, password)
   except Exception:
       print("Decryption failed. Please check your password and try again.")
   ```

3. **Insufficient Logging**:
   - Not logging security-relevant events
   - Logging too much (including sensitive data)
   - Failing to review logs regularly

## Security Incident Response

How to respond to security incidents involving encrypted data:

### Detection

1. **Signs of Compromise**:
   - Unexpected file access or modifications
   - Authentication failures
   - Unusual system behavior
   - Reports of data appearing in unauthorized locations

2. **Monitoring Systems**:
   - Implement intrusion detection systems
   - Monitor for unusual access patterns
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities

### Response Procedures
