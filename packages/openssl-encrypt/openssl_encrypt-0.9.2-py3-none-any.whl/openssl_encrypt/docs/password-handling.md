# Secure Password and Sensitive Data Handling

This document explains how sensitive data like passwords are securely handled in the encryption tool to prevent data leakage through memory dumps or other memory-based attacks, as well as providing details on the password policy implementation.

## Memory Security Architecture

### Core Security Principles

1. **Zero-after-use**: All sensitive data is securely zeroed immediately after use
2. **Memory locking**: Prevention of sensitive data being swapped to disk
3. **Secure memory allocation**: Direct memory management for sensitive buffers
4. **Defense in depth**: Multiple layers of memory protection

## Implementation Details

### SecureString Class

The `SecureString` class provides a secure container for password storage:

```python
from typing import Optional

class SecureString:
    def __init__(self, value: Optional[str] = None):
        self._buffer = self._create_secure_buffer(value)
        self._size = len(self._buffer) if self._buffer else 0

    def __enter__(self):
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        self.wipe()
```

### Secure Memory Buffer

The `SecureBuffer` class handles low-level memory operations:

- Direct memory allocation
- Memory page locking
- Secure wiping protocols
- Protection against core dumps

### Memory Protection Features

1. **Memory Locking**
   - Prevents sensitive data from being swapped to disk
   - Uses platform-specific APIs (mlock on Unix, VirtualLock on Windows)
   - Fallback mechanisms when locking isn't available

2. **Secure Wiping**
   - Multiple overwrite passes with different patterns
   - Zero-fill final pass
   - Hardware-specific optimizations where available

3. **Memory Allocation**
   - Direct memory allocation for sensitive buffers
   - Page-aligned allocation where possible
   - Memory protection flags (no-execute, no-share)

## Password Handling Workflow

### 1. Password Input

```python
def handle_password_input(password: str) -> SecureString:
    with SecureString(password) as secure_pass:
        # Process password
        return secure_pass
```

### 2. Key Derivation

```python
def derive_key(secure_password: SecureString, salt: bytes) -> bytes:
    with secure_password as password:
        # Perform key derivation
        key = kdf.derive(password, salt)
    return key
```

### 3. Encryption/Decryption

```python
def encrypt_data(data: bytes, key: bytes) -> bytes:
    try:
        # Perform encryption
        return encrypted_data
    finally:
        # Secure cleanup
        wipe_memory(key)
```

## Security Measures by Operation

### Password Generation

- Random passwords are generated directly in secure memory
- Temporary buffers are immediately wiped
- Memory is locked during generation

### Password Verification

- Constant-time comparison operations
- No password caching
- Immediate cleanup after verification

### Key Management

- Keys are derived in secure memory
- Intermediate values are wiped
- Key material is never written to disk unencrypted

## Best Practices Implementation

### 1. Memory Management

```python
def secure_operation():
    try:
        # Allocate secure memory
        # Perform operation
        pass
    finally:
        # Guaranteed cleanup
        cleanup_sensitive_data()
```

### 2. Error Handling

```python
def process_sensitive_data():
    try:
        # Process data
        pass
    except Exception:
        # Secure cleanup even on error
        secure_cleanup()
        raise
```

### 3. Resource Management

- Context managers for automatic cleanup
- Explicit memory wiping
- Resource tracking and cleanup verification

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Linux/Unix
- Uses mlock() for memory locking
- Implements MADV_DONTDUMP where available
- Respects RLIMIT_MEMLOCK limits

### Windows
- Uses VirtualLock() for memory locking
- Implements process memory protection
- Handles DEP and ASLR correctly

### macOS
- Uses mlock() and vm_protect()
- Implements additional Mach VM security
- Handles App Sandbox restrictions

## Testing and Verification

### Memory Security Tests

```bash
# Run memory security tests
pytest tests/test_memory_security.py

# Run leak detection tests
pytest tests/test_memory_leaks.py
```

### Security Audit Tools

1. Memory analysis tools supported:
   - valgrind
   - AddressSanitizer
   - Dr. Memory

2. Automated security scans:
   - Memory leak detection
   - Buffer overflow checks
   - Use-after-free detection

## Emergency Response

In case of memory-related security incidents:

1. Immediate process termination
2. Secure memory wiping
3. Logging of security events
4. Notification of security breach

## Recommendations for Users

1. Use the SecureString class for password handling
2. Enable memory locking when possible
3. Verify memory security tests pass
4. Monitor for security updates
5. Follow secure coding guidelines

For additional security measures or custom implementations, please consult the security team or open an issue in the project repository.

## Password Policy Implementation

The encryption tool now includes robust password policy features to enforce secure password usage.

### Policy Levels

Four predefined policy levels are available:

1. **Minimal**: Basic length requirement only (8 characters)
2. **Basic**: Moderate requirements (10+ characters, uppercase, lowercase, numbers)
3. **Standard**: Strong requirements (12+ characters, all character types, moderate entropy)
4. **Paranoid**: Very strong requirements (16+ characters, all character types, high entropy, common password checks)

### Password Validation Features

1. **Length Requirements**: Enforces minimum password length based on policy level
2. **Character Complexity**: Requires specific character classes (lowercase, uppercase, digits, special)
3. **Entropy Calculation**: Computes and validates password entropy in bits
4. **Common Password Detection**: Checks against databases of known weak passwords
5. **Timing-Safe Operations**: All validation uses constant-time operations to prevent timing attacks

### Command-Line Options

```
# Password Policy Options
  --password-policy {minimal,basic,standard,paranoid,none}
                        Password policy level to enforce (default: standard)
  --min-password-length MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH
                        Minimum password length (overrides policy level)
  --min-password-entropy MIN_PASSWORD_ENTROPY
                        Minimum password entropy in bits (overrides policy level)
  --disable-common-password-check
                        Disable checking against common password lists
  --force-password     Force acceptance of weak passwords (use with caution)
  --custom-password-list CUSTOM_PASSWORD_LIST
                        Path to custom common password list file
```

### Common Password Protection

The tool includes:

1. **Embedded Common Password List**: Core protection even without external files
2. **Standard Word Lists**: Integration with system dictionaries when available
3. **Custom List Support**: Option to specify your own weak password database

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Generate a password meeting standard policy
python -m openssl_encrypt.crypt generate-password

# Encrypt with paranoid policy
python -m openssl_encrypt.crypt encrypt -i file.txt -o file.enc --password-policy paranoid

# Force a weak password (not recommended)
python -m openssl_encrypt.crypt encrypt -i file.txt -o file.enc --force-password

# Custom policy requirements
python -m openssl_encrypt.crypt encrypt -i file.txt -o file.enc --min-password-length 20 --min-password-entropy 100
```

### Technical Implementation

The password policy implementation:

1. Uses constant-time operations for security-critical validations
2. Provides detailed feedback for improving password strength
3. Integrates with the secure memory architecture
4. Is extensible for custom validation rules
