## Security Level Classification

The following security levels are defined according to NIST SP 800-57 and PQC standards:

| Security Level | Classical Equivalent | PQC Equivalent | Recommendation |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Level 1 | AES-128 | ML-KEM-512 | Minimum for general data |
| Level 3 | AES-192 | ML-KEM-768 | Recommended for sensitive data |
| Level 5 | AES-256 | ML-KEM-1024 | Recommended for top-secret data |

For the foreseeable future, Level 3 (ML-KEM-768) is the recommended minimum for any data requiring long-term protection.
