# Metadata Restructuring Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds support for format_version 4 which introduces a more organized hierarchical metadata structure while maintaining backward compatibility with previous versions (1-3).

## Changes Made

1. **Core Implementations**
   - Added helper functions in crypt_core.py to convert between metadata formats
   - Updated encryption to use the new hierarchical structure (format_version 4)
   - Implemented backward compatibility for decryption of older formats (1-3)
   - Created utility functions for format conversion

2. **Metadata Structure**
   - Organized metadata into logical sections:
     - `derivation_config`: Contains key derivation settings
     - `hashes`: Contains hash verification information
     - `encryption`: Contains encryption-related settings and keys

3. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Added version detection during decryption
   - Implemented format-specific handling for each version
   - Preserved all fields and functionality from previous versions

4. **Library Updates**
   - Updated keystore_wrapper.py to handle both old and new formats
   - Updated keystore_utils.py to extract information from both formats
   - Updated utility tools like debug_decrypt.py

5. **Tests**
   - Added comprehensive test suite (test_format_version4.py)
   - Tests for format_version 4 encryption
   - Tests for backward compatibility with format_version 3
   - Tests for cross-decryption between formats

6. **Documentation**
   - Added detailed documentation of the new format (metadata_format_v4.md)
   - Documented the format structure and field meanings
   - Documented conversion functions and backward compatibility

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Metadata is now organized into logical sections that group related fields together
2. **Extensibility**: The hierarchical structure makes it easier to add new features in the future
3. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing files can still be decrypted without modification
4. **Improved Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of the format makes it easier to understand and work with

## Next Steps

1. Add more extensive testing to ensure all edge cases are covered
2. Consider adding a migration tool to convert existing files to the new format if desired
3. Update other tools and utilities to leverage the improved structure

This implementation meets all the requirements for the metadata restructuring task while ensuring a smooth transition between format versions.
