This project is a branch of [zstandard](https://pypi.org/project/zstandard/) on [QPython](https://www.qpython.org).

This project provides Python bindings for interfacing with the Zstandard compression library. A C extension and CFFI interface are provided.

The primary goal of the project is to provide a rich interface to the underlying C API through a Pythonic interface while not sacrificing performance. This means exposing most of the features and flexibility of the C API while not sacrificing usability or safety that Python provides.

The canonical home for this project is https://github.com/indygreg/python-zstandard.
