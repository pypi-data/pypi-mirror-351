              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# `pyIsoPEP`: Isotonic PEP Estimator

## Overview
`pyIsoPEP` provides both a [**Docker image**](https://github.com/statisticalbiotechnology/smooth_q_to_pep/pkgs/container/pyisotonicpep) and a [**Python API**](https://pypi.org/project/pyIsoPEP/) with a unified interface for estimating smooth, non‑decreasing Posterior Error Probabilities (PEPs) directly from empirical null models using isotonic regression for target identifications in shotgun proteomics.

Two workflows are available:

| workflow | scheme | starting point |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **q2pep** | rank-based | 	a list of target identifications with *q-values* |
| **d2pep** | score-based | target‑decoy competition (TDC) output: a list of target and decoy identifications with *scores* |

Internally, both workflows use isotonic regression - implemented via either the Pool-Adjacent-Violators Algorithm (PAVA) or I‑Splines. Optional post-processing can be applied to derive q-values from the estimated PEPs. 

pyIsoPEP substantially enhances the robustness of PEP estimation and supports post-processing for both **DDA** and **DIA** data. The same implementation is also incorporated into [**Percolator**](http://percolator.ms/) (C++).

## Installation

### PyPI

```bash
pip install pyIsoPEP
```

### Docker image

```bash
podman pull ghcr.io/statisticalbiotechnology/pyisotonicpep:main

## Input & output

**Input:** tab‑separated value (TSV) files; column names are configurable.  
**Output:** the original **target** rows plus up to four extra columns:

| column | present when | description |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| `pyIsoPEP FDR` | `--calc-q-from-fdr` | estimated False Discovery Rates (FDRs) |
| `pyIsoPEP q-value from FDR` | `--calc-q-from-fdr` | FDR-derived q-values |
| `pyIsoPEP PEP` | always | estimated PEPs |
| `pyIsoPEP q-value from PEP` | `--calc-q-from-pep` | PEP-derived q-values |
