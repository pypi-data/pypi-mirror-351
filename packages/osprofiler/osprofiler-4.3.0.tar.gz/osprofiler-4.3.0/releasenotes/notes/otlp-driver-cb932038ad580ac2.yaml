    An OTLP (OpenTelemetry) exporter is now supported. The current
    support is experimental but the aim is to deprecate and remove
    legacy Jaeger driver which is using the already deprecated python
    library jaeger client. Operators who want to use it should enable
    `otlp`. OTLP is comptatible with Jaeger backend.
