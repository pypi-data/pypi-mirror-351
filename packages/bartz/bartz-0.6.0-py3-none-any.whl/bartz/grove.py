Functions to create and manipulate binary trees.

A tree is represented with arrays as a heap. The root node is at index 1. The children nodes of a node at index :math:`i` are at indices :math:`2i` (left child) and :math:`2i + 1` (right child). The array element at index 0 is unused.

A decision tree is represented by tree arrays: 'leaf', 'var', and 'split'.

The 'leaf' array contains the values in the leaves.

The 'var' array contains the axes along which the decision nodes operate.

The 'split' array contains the decision boundaries. The boundaries are open on the right, i.e., a point belongs to the left child iff x < split. Whether a node is a leaf is indicated by the corresponding 'split' element being 0. Unused nodes also have split set to 0.

Since the nodes at the bottom can only be leaves and not decision nodes, the 'var' and 'split' arrays have half the length of the 'leaf' array.
