# fast-c2pa-python

A high-performance Python library for reading C2PA metadata.

## Overview

This library provides extremely fast C2PA metadata extraction from digital assets using direct PyO3 bindings to the Rust C2PA implementation. It was created to address performance bottlenecks in existing Python C2PA libraries.

> **Note:** This library is designed for reading C2PA metadata only. It does not support writing or creating C2PA metadata at this time.

## Benchmarks

| Implementation | Average Read Time |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| c2pa-python (UniFFI) | ~486ms |
| numbers-c2pa | ~17ms |
| fast-c2pa-python (PyO3) | ~8ms |
| Native Rust | ~7ms |

## Installation

```bash
pip install fast-c2pa-python
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from fast_c2pa_python import read_c2pa_from_file

# Read C2PA metadata from a file (with automatic MIME type detection)
metadata = read_c2pa_from_file("path/to/image.jpg")
print(metadata)

# You can also specify the MIME type explicitly if needed
metadata = read_c2pa_from_file("path/to/image.jpg", "image/jpeg")
```

### Reading from Binary Data

```python
from fast_c2pa_python import read_c2pa_from_bytes

# From HTTP response or other binary source
response = requests.get("https://example.com/image.jpg")
metadata = read_c2pa_from_bytes(response.content, "image/jpeg")

# Or from a file opened in binary mode
with open("path/to/image.jpg", "rb") as f:
    data = f.read()
    metadata = read_c2pa_from_bytes(data, "image/jpeg")
```

### Example Output

```python
{
    "title": "Image Title",
    "generator": "Adobe Photoshop",
    "thumbnail": {...},
    "assertions": [...],
    "signature_info": {
        "issuer": "Example Issuer",
        "time": "2023-05-23T10:30:15Z",
        "cert_serial_number": "1234567890"
    },
    "ingredients": [...],
    # Additional manifest data
}
```

## Testing

The library includes both API compatibility tests and performance benchmarks to ensure functionality and speed.

### Running Tests

Install test dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
```

Run all tests:

```bash
python run_tests.py 
```

## Development

This library is built using [Maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin), which provides Python bindings for Rust with [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3).

### Setting Up Development Environment

```bash
# Install Maturin
pip install maturin

# Development build (debug mode)
maturin develop

# Run in release mode for better performance
maturin develop --release
```

### Building Wheel Files

```bash
# Build wheel for the current platform
maturin build --release

Wheel files are generated in the `target/wheels/` directory and can be shared directly with users who can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install /path/to/fast_c2pa_python-x.x.x-cp3xx-cp3xx-platform.whl
```
