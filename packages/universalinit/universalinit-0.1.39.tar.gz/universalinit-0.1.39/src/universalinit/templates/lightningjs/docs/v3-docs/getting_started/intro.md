The Blits framework uses a **readable** XML-style template syntax and comes with built-in reactivity.

## Why Blits?

You may be wondering where the name Blits comes from.

Firstly, it's short, memorable and just has a nice ring to it.

"Blits" is a Dutch word (a significant portion of the Lightning Open Source teams is based in the Netherlands). It means _flashy_ and it's often used for things that are _great_ or _cool_.

Finally, it's a nerdy reference to the computer term "Bit Blits" commonly used in graphics processing, for rapidly moving a block of data into memory - quite similar to what Lightning is doing ðŸ™‚
