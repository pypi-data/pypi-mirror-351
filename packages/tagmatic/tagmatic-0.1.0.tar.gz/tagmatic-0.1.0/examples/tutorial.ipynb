    "    *   Avoid overlapping categories as much as possible. If overlap is unavoidable, ensure descriptions clearly differentiate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **High-Quality Examples**:\n",
    "    *   Provide diverse and representative examples for each category.\n",
    "    *   Include edge cases or tricky examples if known.\n",
    "    *   The quality of examples significantly impacts LLM performance.\n",

    "3.  **Iterate on Categories and Prompts**:\n",
    "    *   Start with a basic set of categories and refine them based on classification results.\n",
    "    *   Experiment with prompt phrasing if the default prompt isn't yielding optimal results for your specific LLM or task.\n",

    "4.  **Use Voting for Critical Tasks**:\n",

    "5.  **Choose the Right LLM**:\n",

    "7.  **Pre-processing Text (Optional)**:\n",

    "\n",
    "8.  **Monitor and Evaluate**:\n",

    "    *   Track metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each category.\n",
