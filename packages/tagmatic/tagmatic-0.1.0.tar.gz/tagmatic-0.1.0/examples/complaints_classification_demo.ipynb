    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "A financial institution receives thousands of consumer complaints daily. These complaints need to be automatically categorized to route them to the appropriate departments for resolution. Instead of manually creating rules or training complex ML models, we can use Tagmatic to define categories through simple descriptions and let the LLM handle the classification.\n",

    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We're using a sample of 50 consumer complaints (10 examples from each of 5 categories) from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) database. This dataser was taken from Kaggle. You can find it here:\n",
