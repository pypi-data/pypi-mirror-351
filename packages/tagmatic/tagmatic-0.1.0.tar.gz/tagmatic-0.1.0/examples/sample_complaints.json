A Forbearance period marks your monthly payments as current while you are not paying on your loans and mines are n't reflecting that.

Long story short, they lied about their cancellation terms, and when I went to cancel services, said that I would still be charged, added multiple new charges, and jacked up their rates. I am currently in dispute with this company. \n\nI spoke with the fraud department of my credit card company, Capital One, about what I could do to stop these charges. They told me that there was nothing I could do, because they were unable to block charges from this company. They advised me that the best way to handle this situation was to have Capital One cancel my current card, and issue me a new one. \n\nI received my new card on XX/XX/XXXX, and on the morning of XX/XX/XXXX I had it activated. I then went to my XXXX account to update my card info there, only to find that somehow it had already been updated! I have had a lot of problems with fraud in the past, having to change my credit card number eight times in the past year, and was afraid that my Capital One account and also my XXXX account had been hacked. \n\nImmediately, I called XXXX. They told me this was nothing to worry about, because they have agreements with certain banks so that if their customers update their card info with their bank, the bank automatically sends XXXX the information, too. \n\nThis was very concerning to me. Capital One never informed me that they do this. \n\nI called Capital One, and was given the run-around for ten hours! \n\nI was transferred and transferred and transferred. No one could understand my concerns. They never heard of something like this happening before. They are not authorized to give out my card number to anyone. Finally, they told me Mastercard must have done it, and gave me a number to call Mastercard. \n\nI called Mastercard. They, too, had no idea what I was talking about. They told me they do not save any information, so therefore could not give out my new card information to anyone. It must have been Capital One. \n\nI called Capital One again, and was told multiple times that they don't know why Mastercard is lying to me, because they must have given out the information. Finally, someone at Capital One 's fraud department told me that this was not fraud, or a hacker who got into my Capital One and XXXX accounts. They said it was a service provided to merchants who consumers have recurring charges with, so that consumers can be provided uninterrupted service when they forget to update their billing information. \n\nThey said they had no list of merchants who paid for this service, and there was no way to tell who my new card information was sent to. \n\nI told them what Capital One 's fraud department told me before about the merchant I was in dispute with, how my only recourse was to change cards. \n\nThis representative told me that that was not the case, that because of this service and the fact that there is no way to tell what merchants are paying for it, my new card information could very well be sent to the company that I am disputing, and they could therefore fraudulently charge my card. \n\nI said that no one should have the right to give out my card number except me, how did they do this without my knowledge? Capital One again told me that they do not have authorization to give out my card information, it had to be Mastercard. \n\nI called Mastercard again, and they told me the same thing as before, that they never heard of such a thing, they don't store my information, and therefore could not have given it out. I had them do a three-way conference call with Capital One, and I had the lady with Mastercard tell the Capital One representative what they told me, that they do not know what Capital One is talking about, and that they do not store or give out card info. The Capital One representative said he didn't know what to tell me, he was always told that it was Mastercard doing this. \n\nI am XXXX and have an extremely difficult time reading online, particularly long privacy policies and terms of use with all the fine print. So I had my children help me to scour the internet and capitalone.com. \n\nAfter several hours, we concluded that it is a service that Mastercard provides to \" trusted '' merchants ( merchants who pay them money ) called Automatic Billing Updater. When a consumer changes card information, such as getting a new expiration date or a whole new card number, the information is sent to these merchants. There is no way for me to tell which merchants may be paying for this service. The merchant I am disputing could very well get my new card info, leaving me back at square one. I also decided that I needed a smaller internet footprint, which was another reason for changing this card. I recently closed several of my online accounts due to problems I have had with fraud. Could these people I purchased from in the past also have my new card info? Capital One and Mastercard say they don't know who they send it out to. And another problem, there is no way to guarantee that people Mastercard sends my new card information to won't then give it to someone else. \n\nA year ago, someone hacked my Capital One card and subscribed to some dating site on XXXX called XXXX, and even though I have changed my credit card number eight times now, this person with this XXXX account somehow has been able to get each card. Are they accomplishing this with the Automatic Billing Updater? There is no way to know. \n\nWe also discovered that Capital One mentions the Automatic Billing Updater nowhere in their privacy policy or terms of service. I called to ask about it, and where to find it in their privacy policy, and they deny even using it, they have no idea what the Automatic Billing Updater is. When I told them they do use it, and they do know what it is, Capital One said that there is no way for me to opt out of it. \n\nI found that a lot of other banks tell consumers about the Automatic Billing Updater upfront, and give them the option to opt out. I found several news articles saying your bank must opt you out if you ask them. But Capital One tells me they will not. \n\nI called Mastercard on XX/XX/XXXX and said I wanted to opt out of the Automatic Billing Updater. Suddenly by some miracle they knew exactly what I was talking about, and said they would opt me out. Why couldn't they tell this was what I was talking about yesterday? \n\nI am livid about how I was given the run around for ten hours, being lied to over and over again, by Capital One and Mastercard, when they all knew perfectly well what I was talking about, and they were trying to hide it. How could they be using a service that the customer service representatives know so little about? How could they be able to give out my card information without my consent? \n\nI have extreme vestibular problems that cause me to be dizzy constantly. It is aggravated by eye strain and stress, and after a couple hours of this nonsense I had to have my daughter step in and help me deal with these people at Capital One. By the end of the ten hours of going around and around on the phone, I felt so sick I could hardly eat dinner. \n\nI think customers should be notified of services like this Automatic Billing Updater upfront. I think customers should have to opt-in when they decide they want the service, rather than having to opt-out when they get a surprise because a merchant they didn't want to pay magically got their card info. \n\nI think there should be a list that I can check of the merchants who use this Automatic Billing Updater, so I can find out who is out there that might have my credit card number. \n\nI don't like at all how Capital One hid the fact that they use Automatic Billing Updater, and lied to me for ten hours. \n\nI don't like how Mastercard hid the fact that they offer the Automatic Billing Updater to merchants, can get away with not telling consumers about it, and also lied to me yesterday multiple times. \n\nAgain, it is my credit card, and my credit. Shouldn't I be the only one allowed to give that number out? I consider it a safety issue, too, because last year I purchase a leather bag from a person in XXXX, and then was constantly harassed by him to the point of calling the police. If he were able to get a hold of my new card number now, what do you think he would do? I think a lot of the reason for me having to change my card number eight times is because of this Automatic Billing Updater. \n\nI don't like how XXXX and whoever else can sign up for a service that gives out my personal information without having to inform me about it. I also can not find in XXXX 's privacy policy or terms of service any mention of the Automatic Billing Updater. \n\nI don't think that it is correct that Capital One can not opt me out. And I don't think that it is right that they should be able to give out my personal information to whomever will pay them for it. \n\nIt is very creepy that my card information can be given out to whoever at who knows where and Mastercard has no idea who that might be. I have had my XXXX account, for instance, since the XXXX. Who knows what other companies I did business with back then who might now have my current credit card number."

The creditor is claiming that I am responsible for this charge ( which happened to be the highest one ). The creditor stated that they contacted the merchant, who told them that the card was present at the time of the transaction. This is not accurate, and I would be willing to review security tapes at the merchant to prove that I was not there using the credit card.\n\nI am requesting that the error be corrected, that any finance and other charges related to the disputed amount be credited as well, and that I receive an accurate statement.\n\nLastly, if the creditor insist that I am responsible for the fraudulent charge, Federal law limits my responsibility for unauthorized charges to {$50.00} under the Fair Credit Billing Act. \n\nPlease investigate this matter and correct the billing error as soon as possible."

I returned the call to the bank and was advised by the fraud department that my phone number is indeed linked to an account ( not in my name, or held by me ) that exhibited signs of fraudulent activity. I advised the bank that the account and activity are unrelated to me, and that my phone number should not be listed or linked to any account with Fifth Third bank, since I do not maintain any account there. I was advised that this was not possible, \" since I am not the account holder ''. \n\nI do not want my private phone number associated with Fifth Third bank or any account at the bank, since phone number information is commonly cross-linked to a great deal of personal and financial data within the financial services community. It is inappropriate and poor financial management for the bank to allow my phone number to be improperly linked to a known fraudulent account, when I am not in fact associated with that account or fraudulent activity. My concern is that my personal phone number will be improperly linked to accounts or activity that are not related to me. \n\nDespite requests to escalate my request to an agent empowered to remove my personal phone number, the bank was unwilling to escalate to resolve the problem. I would imagine that this could make a worthy class action suit if consumers have been harmed by the improper linking of their data to unrelated transactions, despite the consumer 's repeated attempts to get the bank to correct its records."

They re-vamped their website and asked me to verify some additional information such as home phone, work phone, cell phone and e-mail address. I 'm ok with that. Scrolling down, they now wanted an update on my yearly income and my employment status. The following is a copy/paste directly from their login screen : We use income information for ongoing card account management purposes, which may include consideration for a future credit line increase. You may include : 1. Personal income, which is income you have earned, including full-time, part-time, or seasonal jobs, self-employment, interest or dividend, retirement, and public assistance. 2. Shared income, which is money from somebody else that is regularly deposited into your individual account or into a joint account that person shares with you. If you are 21 or over, you may also include somebody else 's income that is regularly used to pay your expenses. Total Annual Income* $ *Alimony, child support or separate maintenance income need not be revealed if you do not choose to have it considered as a basis for repayment. Employment Status I called Capital One and complained because I 'm an existing customer for over 30 years and all I wanted to do was pay my bill online. They told me this was FEDERAL LAW and I had to update this information in order to pay my bill online. I escalated to several \" supervisors '', but it 's like talking to a wall reading from a script. I have no interest in a credit increase and absolutely no desire to allow them to manage my account. I manage my own account. If I had requested a credit increase or some other product, I could see that they would ask me for this type of information, however, I have not requested anything. I JUST WANT TO PAY MY BILL ONLINE WITHOUT GIVING THIS TYPE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. THIS IS A VIOLATION OF MY PRIVACY. I have never been late with a payment and usually pay them over the minimum due. Their resolution to the problem was for me to enter inaccurate information, like {$0.00} for income and Unemployed or whatever other reason I choose. This would allow me to bypass the screen and continue on to pay my bill. This makes absolutely no sense. Would Federal Law allow you to lie about your income and employment status? This is some sort of phishing scam direct from Capital One. NONE of my other creditors have asked for this type of information when paying my bills online."

On Friday, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I picked up my new replacement credit card from XXXX from my XXXX XXXX XXXX I check this box once or twice a week for mail. I waited until Monday, XXXX XXXX, XXXX to call to activate the new card so I could call all the vendors that have automatic billing to give them the new credit card number ( as instructed in XXXX 's instructions with the new card ). When I called the vendor, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I reached the automated billing system. This system TOLD ME my NEW credit card number and NEW expiration date. I had NOT given AHS this information. I called XXXX to ask how XXXX got my new credit card number since I had just received it and activated it. The agent said CHASE does not give out that information and offered to change the card number. I called XXXX next. The agent said their file showed on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, the new credit card number was updated when XXXX sent an alert that my old card was going to expire and XXXX gave the new credit card number and the system synchronized and updated the number. ( The old card was valid to XXXX, but XXXX was dropping the military program and also changed from MC to XXXX so XXXX was issuing new cards to members. ) I called XXXX back again and spoke with XXXX in XXXX, XXXX, the Fraud supervisor, XXXX in the Disputes Dept and finally, XXXX, a Disputes supervisor. They all said they are not allowed to give out credit card numbers, however, did verify this new number was used for XXXX 's automatic billing on XXXX XXXX, XXXX before I even had the new card or activated it.

XXXX, in the XXXX XXXX said XXXX did it, but she did n't know how to answer my question and she forwarded me to her supervisor, XXXX. XXXX said XXXX does the automatic update and XXXX has some authorization on file with XXXX to allow this ( however, the other automatic billing vendors do n't have this authorization? ). She also could not answer my question : HOW WAS XXXX ALLOWED TO PUT CHARGES ON A CREDIT CARD I HAD NOT YET RECEIVED NOR ACTIVATED? ALSO, WHY WERE THEY GIVEN THIS CARD NUMBER WITHOUT MY AUTHORIZATION? None of the people at XXXX could answer this question, they took no responsibility, and blamed XXXX and XXXX. \n\nThis is a SERIOUS breach of the security I should have over who has access to my credit card number unless I give it to them. Also, if XXXX and XXXX are automatically giving out credit card numbers to vendors this needs to be addressed immediately.
