# cxg-query-enhancer

A Python library that enhances biological queries by automatically expanding ontology terms (like cell types, tissues, etc.) to include all subtypes and part-of relationships based on underlying ontologies. This ensures that queries for general terms (e.g., 'macrophage', 'kidney') also capture annotations to more specific entities (like 'alveolar macrophage', 'renal cortex'), making your [CellXGene Census](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/cellxgene-census/) queries more comprehensive.

## The Challenge: Incomplete Queries in Biological Data

When exploring biological datasets, querying for a general term like "macrophage" often misses data annotated with more specific subtypes (e.g., "alveolar macrophage," "Kupffer cell"). Similarly, a search for "kidney" might not automatically include its constituent parts like "renal cortex" or "nephron." Manually identifying and including all these related terms for every query is time-consuming and prone to omissions, leading to incomplete results.

**How `cxg-query-enhancer` Solves This:**

cxg_query_enhancer tackles this by automatically enhancing your queries in the [CellXGene Census](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/cellxgene-census/). It uses the [Ubergraph](https://github.com/INCATools/ubergraph) knowledge graph to find all relevant subtypes and parts for your search terms and automatically expand your query. By default, it also filters these expanded terms against the latest version of the [CellXGene Census](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/cellxgene-census/), ensuring results are both comprehensive and relevant to your dataset. 

## Key Features

`cxg-query-enhancer` provides:

1. **Automated query expansion**: Rewrites query filters to include all subtypes and parts of specified terms.
2. **Multiple ontology support**: 
   - [Cell Ontology (CL)](https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology) for cell types
   - [Uberon](https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon) for anatomical structures
   - [MONDO](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo) for diseases
   - Developmental stage ontologies 
        - [Human Developmental Stages (HsapDv)](https://github.com/obophenotype/developmental-stage-ontologies)
        - [Mouse Developmental Stages (MmusDv)](https://github.com/obophenotype/developmental-stage-ontologies)
3. **Flexible Term Input**: Accepts input terms as:
  - Labels (e.g., 'neuron', 'kidney')
  - Ontology IDs (e.g., 'CL:0000540', 'UBERON:0002113')
  - Ontology synonyms
4. **CellxGene Census Filtering**: 
  - By default, filters expanded Ubergraph terms against the **"latest"** version of the [CellXGene Census](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/cellxgene-census/).
  - You can customize this using the `census_version` parameter in the `enhance` function:
    - You can specify a particular version string (e.g., a date like `"2024-12-01"`).
    - You can set to `None` to disable census filtering (in which case, only Ubergraph expansion is performed).
  - This filtering requires the `organism` parameter (e.g., `"homo_sapiens"`, `"mus_musculus"`) to ensure species-appropriate term matching against the census data.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-pipx) (for managing dependencies)
- Python >=3.10,<3.12

## Installation

You can install **cxg-query-enhancer PyPI package** using `pip`

```bash
# Using pip
pip install cxg-query-enhancer

# Using Poetry
poetry add cxg-query-enhancer

```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Query Expansion (Ubergraph Only and No Census Filtering)

```python
from cxg_query_enhancer import enhance

# Original query filter
original_query = "cell_type in ['neuron']"

# Expand to include all subtypes of neurons (no Census filtering)
expanded_query = enhance(
    original_query,
    census_version=None  # disable census filtering
)

print(expanded_query)

# Output: cell_type in ['neuron', 'Purkinje neuron', 'motor neuron', ...]
```

### Example 2: Multiple Categories with Census Filtering

```python
from cxg_query_enhancer import enhance

# Expand cell types, tissues, diseases, and development stages, but filter against terms in the Census

original_query = "cell_type in ['medium spiny neuron'] and tissue in ['kidney'] and disease in ['diabetes mellitus'] and development_stage in ['10-month-old stage']"

expanded_query = enhance(
    original_query,   
    organism="homo_sapiens",  # specify the organism for accurate Census filtering                           
    )

print(expanded_query)

# Output: cell_type in ['direct pathway medium spiny neuron', 'indirect pathway medium spiny neuron', 'medium spiny neuron'] and tissue in ['cortex of kidney', 'kidney', 'kidney blood vessel', 'renal medulla', 'renal papilla', 'renal pelvis'] and disease in ['type 1 diabetes mellitus', 'type 2 diabetes mellitus'] and development_stage in ['10-month-old stage']

```

## Function Reference
### Main Function

### `enhance(query_filter, categories=None, organism=None, census_version="latest")`

Rewrites a query filter to include the subtypes and part-of relationships of specified terms.

#### Parameters:

- **query_filter** (str): The original query filter string.
- **categories** (`list` or `None`): Categories to expand.
  - **If `None` (default):** Categories are auto-detected by scanning the query for patterns like `cell_type in [...]` or `tissue_ontology_term_id in [...]`.
  - **If a list (e.g., `["cell_type", "disease"]`):** Only the specified categories are expanded.
  - Supported categories: `"cell_type"`, `"tissue"`, `"disease"`, `"development_stage"`. 
- **organism** (str): The organism to query in the census (e.g., `"homo_sapiens"`, `"mus_musculus"`).
  - **Required for**: Census filtering (which is active by default) and processing the `"development_stage"` category.
  - **Default**: If not provided by the user, defaults to `"homo_sapiens"` for census filtering (if active), unless it's required and missing for a `"development_stage"` query (which would raise a `ValueError`).
- **census_version** (str): Version of the CellXGene Census to use for filtering terms against the census.
  - **Default: `"latest"`** for the most recent version
  - Specify a date like `"2024-12-01"` for reproducible results
  - Set to `None` to disable filtering and perform only ontology expansion

#### Returns:

- **str**: The rewritten query filter with expanded terms.

### Additional Classes

These classes are used internally and don't need to be called directly:

#### `SPARQLClient`

A client for interacting with Ubergraph endpoint using SPARQL queries.

#### `OntologyExtractor`

Extracts subclasses and part-of relationships from Ubergraph for ontology terms.

## How It Works

1. **Parse Query:** The library identifies terms in your query that need expansion
2. **Resolve Terms:** For each term, it:
   - Resolves labels to ontology IDs (if necessary)
   - Queries Ubergraph to find all subclasses and part-of relationships
   - Filters the expanded terms against the CellXGene Census
3. **Rewrite Query:** The expanded terms are rewritten into the original query format
