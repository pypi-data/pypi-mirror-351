## What is MockLoop MCP?

MockLoop MCP is a comprehensive MCP server that automates the generation and execution of feature-rich mock API servers directly from API documentation (initially focusing on OpenAPI/Swagger specifications). This enables developers to quickly obtain a functional mock environment for development and testing purposes, reducing dependencies on live backend systems and facilitating parallel workflows.

## Key Features

### üöÄ Core Capabilities
- **API Mock Generation**: Takes an API specification (URL or local file) and generates a runnable FastAPI mock server
- **Request/Response Logging**: Generated mock servers include middleware for comprehensive logging with SQLite storage
- **Dockerized Mocks**: Generates `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for each mock API
- **OpenAPI Support**: Initial support for OpenAPI v2 (Swagger) and v3 (JSON, YAML)

### üîç Enhanced Features (v2.0+)
- **Advanced Log Analysis**: Query and analyze request logs with filtering, performance metrics, and intelligent insights
- **Server Discovery**: Automatically discover running mock servers and match them with generated configurations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics, error rate analysis, and traffic pattern detection
- **AI Assistant Integration**: Optimized for AI-assisted development workflows with structured data output
- **Smart Filtering**: Advanced log filtering by method, path patterns, time ranges, and custom criteria
- **Insights Generation**: Automated analysis with actionable recommendations for debugging and optimization

### ü§ñ AI Framework Integration
- **LangGraph Integration**: Native support for LangGraph workflows
- **CrewAI Integration**: Seamless integration with CrewAI multi-agent systems
- **LangChain Integration**: Built-in tools for LangChain applications
- **Dynamic Response Management**: Real-time response updates without server restart
- **Scenario Management**: Create and switch between different test scenarios instantly

## Quick Start
