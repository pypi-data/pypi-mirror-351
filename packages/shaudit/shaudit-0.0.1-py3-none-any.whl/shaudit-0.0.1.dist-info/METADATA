## 📄 shaudit — Security Headers Audit Tool

**shaudit** is a lightweight CLI tool designed to help you audit HTTP security headers on any website. It checks whether common security headers like Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, and many others are properly implemented or missing.

The output is clean, colorful, and easy to read — perfect for quick assessments directly from your terminal. You can also save the results to a file for later review.

**shaudit** works fully offline and is safe to use in production environments, making it a great choice for:

- Pentesters who need quick insights during engagements
- Security engineers verifying HTTP configurations
- Anyone who wants to scan web headers without the hassle
