# Example notebooks for integrating Active Learning to custom deep learning models

These notebooks provide examples of how to integrate existing deep learning models into the `napari-activelearning` plugin.

## Enabling active learning for Micro-SAM models

This example shows how to integrate Micro-SAM[^1] models into the acquisition function widget of this plugin.
More information about those models can be found on their official github repository [https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/micro-sam](https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/micro-sam).
