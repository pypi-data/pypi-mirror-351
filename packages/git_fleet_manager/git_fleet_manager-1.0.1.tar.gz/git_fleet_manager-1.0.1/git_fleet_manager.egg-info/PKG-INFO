## Features

- **Recursive Repository Discovery**: Automatically finds all Git repositories in a directory and its subdirectories.
- **Selective Repository Management**: Use a `.gfm` file to specify which repositories to manage.
- **Batch Operations**:
  - Check the status of all repositories.
  - Pull changes from remote repositories.
  - Push changes to remote repositories.
  - View commit logs for all repositories.

## Installation

You can install git-fleet-manager using pip:

### From PyPI
```bash
pip install git-fleet-manager
```

### From GitHub (latest development version)
```bash

git-fleet-manager is now ready to use. Run the `gfm` command from anywhere in your terminal.


## Usage

Run the `gfm` command with the desired subcommand and options.

### Commands

```bash
gfm status [directory]
```

- **directory**: The directory to scan for repositories (default: current directory).

#### `pull`
Pull changes for all repositories in the specified directory.

```bash
gfm pull [directory]
```

- **directory**: The directory to scan for repositories (default: current directory).

#### `push`
Push changes for all repositories in the specified directory.

```bash
gfm push [directory]
```

- **directory**: The directory to scan for repositories (default: current directory).

#### `log`
View the commit log for all repositories in the specified directory.

```bash
gfm log [directory] [--max-commits MAX_COMMITS]
```

- **directory**: The directory to scan for repositories (default: current directory).
- **--max-commits**: The maximum number of commits to display for each repository (default: 10).

#### `--version`
Display the current version of git-fleet-manager.

```bash
gfm --version
```

### `.gfm` File

If a `.gfm` file exists in the specified directory, only the repositories listed in the file will be managed. The file should contain one repository path per line, relative to the directory containing the `.gfm` file.

Example `.gfm` file:
```
repo1
subdir/repo2
```

### Examples

1. Check the status of all repositories in the current directory:
   ```bash
   gfm status
   ```

2. Pull changes for all repositories in `/projects`:
   ```bash
   gfm pull /projects
   ```

3. Push changes for repositories listed in a `.gfm` file:
   ```bash
   gfm push /projects
   ```

4. View the last 5 commits for all repositories:
   ```bash
   gfm log /projects --max-commits 5
   ```

5. Display the version of git-fleet-manager:
   ```bash
   gfm --version
   ```
