This project is a branch of [langgraph](https://pypi.org/project/langgraph/) on [QPython](https://www.qpython.org).

Trusted by companies shaping the future of agents – including Klarna, Replit, Elastic, and more – LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents.

## Get started

Install LangGraph:

```
pip install -U langgraph
```

Then, create an agent [using prebuilt components](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/agents/agents/):

```python
# pip install -qU "langchain[anthropic]" to call the model

from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather for a given city."""
    return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

agent = create_react_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
    tools=[get_weather],
    prompt="You are a helpful assistant"
)

# Run the agent
agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather in sf"}]}
)
```

For more information, see the [Quickstart](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/agents/agents/). Or, to learn how to build an [agent workflow](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/) with a customizable architecture, long-term memory, and other complex task handling, see the [LangGraph basics tutorials](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/get-started/1-build-basic-chatbot/).

## Core benefits

LangGraph provides low-level supporting infrastructure for *any* long-running, stateful workflow or agent. LangGraph does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides the following central benefits:

- [Durable execution](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/durable_execution/): Build agents that persist through failures and can run for extended periods, automatically resuming from exactly where they left off.
- [Human-in-the-loop](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/human_in_the_loop/): Seamlessly incorporate human oversight by inspecting and modifying agent state at any point during execution.
- [Comprehensive memory](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/): Create truly stateful agents with both short-term working memory for ongoing reasoning and long-term persistent memory across sessions.
- [Debugging with LangSmith](http://www.langchain.com/langsmith): Gain deep visibility into complex agent behavior with visualization tools that trace execution paths, capture state transitions, and provide detailed runtime metrics.
- [Production-ready deployment](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/deployment_options/): Deploy sophisticated agent systems confidently with scalable infrastructure designed to handle the unique challenges of stateful, long-running workflows.

## LangGraph’s ecosystem

While LangGraph can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly with any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools for building agents. To improve your LLM application development, pair LangGraph with:

- [LangSmith](http://www.langchain.com/langsmith) — Helpful for agent evals and observability. Debug poor-performing LLM app runs, evaluate agent trajectories, gain visibility in production, and improve performance over time.
- [LangGraph Platform](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/#langgraph-platform) — Deploy and scale agents effortlessly with a purpose-built deployment platform for long running, stateful workflows. Discover, reuse, configure, and share agents across teams — and iterate quickly with visual prototyping in [LangGraph Studio](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_studio/).
- [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/) – Provides integrations and composable components to streamline LLM application development.
