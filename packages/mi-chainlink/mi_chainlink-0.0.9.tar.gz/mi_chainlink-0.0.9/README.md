# mi-chainlink

A powerful, flexible framework for entity resolution and record linkage using DuckDB as the database engine built upon the work of [Who Owns Chicago](https://github.com/mansueto-institute/who-owns-chi/) by the [Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation](https://miurban.uchicago.edu/) including the work of [Kevin Bryson](https://github.com/cmdkev), [Ana (Anita) Restrepo Lachman](https://github.com/anitarestrepo16), [Caitlin P.](https://github.com/CaitlinCP), [Joaquin Pinto](https://github.com/joaquinpinto), and [Divij Sinha](https://github.com/divij-sinha). 


This package enables you to load data from various sources, clean and standardize entity names and addresses, and create links between entities based on exact and fuzzy matching techniques.

## Overview

This framework helps you solve the entity resolution problem by:

1. Loading data from multiple sources into a DuckDB database
2. Cleaning and standardizing entity names and addresses
3. Creating exact matches between entities based on names and addresses
4. Generating fuzzy matches using TF-IDF similarity
5. Exporting the resulting linked data for further analysis

The system is designed to be configurable through YAML files and supports incremental updates to an existing database.

## Installation
