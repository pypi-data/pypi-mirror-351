# NAM: Neural Amp Modeler

This repository handles training, reamping, and exporting the weights of a model.
For playing trained models in real time in a standalone application or plugin, see the partner repo,
[NeuralAmpModelerPlugin](https://github.com/sdatkinson/NeuralAmpModelerPlugin).

For documentation, check out the [ReadTheDocs](https://neural-amp-modeler.readthedocs.io).
