### üêõ Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates. When creating a bug report, include:

- **Clear, descriptive title**
- **Steps to reproduce** (be specific!)
- **Expected behavior**
- **Actual behavior**
- **Screenshots** (if applicable)
- **Environment details:**
  ```
  - TurboDRF version: 
  - Python version:
  - Django version:
  - DRF version:
  - OS:
  ```

**Example Bug Report:**
```markdown
Title: Field permissions not applied to nested serializers

Description:
When using nested field notation (author__name), field-level permissions 
are not being enforced correctly.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Define a model with nested fields in turbodrf()
2. Set field permission 'books.book.author__name.read' for admin role only
3. Access API as viewer role
4. The author__name field is visible (should be hidden)

Expected: Field should not be visible to viewer role
Actual: Field is visible to all authenticated users

Environment:
- TurboDRF: 0.1.0
- Python: 3.11
- Django: 4.2
- DRF: 3.14
```

### ‚ú® Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, include:

- **Use case** - Why is this needed?
- **Current behavior** - What happens now?
- **Desired behavior** - What should happen?
- **Alternative solutions** - Have you considered other approaches?
- **Additional context** - Screenshots, mockups, examples

## üíª Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Virtual environment tool (venv, virtualenv, conda)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alexandercollins/turbodrf.git
   cd turbodrf
   ```

2. **Add upstream remote:**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/alexandercollins/turbodrf.git
   ```

3. **Create virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install in development mode:**
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

5. **Install pre-commit hooks:**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

6. **Verify setup:**
   ```bash
   pytest  # Should run all tests successfully
   ```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
# Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# Or for bugs: git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Add docstrings to all functions/classes
- Update tests for new functionality
- Update documentation if needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_permissions.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=turbodrf --cov-report=html

# Check code style
black --check turbodrf/
flake8 turbodrf/
isort --check-only turbodrf/
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
# Format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>

git commit -m "feat(permissions): add field-level permission caching"
git commit -m "fix(router): handle models without turbodrf method"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"
git commit -m "test(views): add edge case for empty queryset"
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

1. **Test file naming:** `test_<module_name>.py`
2. **Test class naming:** `Test<ClassName>`
3. **Test method naming:** `test_<specific_scenario>`

### Test Structure

```python
class TestTurboDRFPermission(TestCase):
    """Test cases for TurboDRF permissions."""
    
    def setUp(self):
        """Set up test fixtures."""
        # Create test data
        pass
    
    def test_admin_can_perform_all_operations(self):
        """Test that admin users have full CRUD access."""
        # Arrange
        user = self.create_admin_user()
        
        # Act
        response = self.client.get('/api/books/')
        
        # Assert
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
    
    def test_viewer_can_only_read(self):
        """Test that viewer users have read-only access."""
        # Test implementation
        pass
```

### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/`) - Test individual components
- **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/`) - Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests** - Test complete user workflows

### Coverage Requirements

- New features must have >90% test coverage
- Bug fixes must include regression tests
- Run `pytest --cov=turbodrf` to check coverage

## üé® Code Style

### Python Style Guide

We use several tools to maintain consistent code style:

1. **Black** - Code formatting (line length: 88)
2. **isort** - Import sorting
3. **flake8** - Linting (max line length: 88)

### Docstring Format

We use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def calculate_permissions(user, model):
    """
    Calculate effective permissions for a user on a model.
    
    This function aggregates permissions from all user roles and returns
    the complete set of permissions applicable to the given model.
    
    Args:
        user: User instance with 'roles' property
        model: Django model class with TurboDRFMixin
        
    Returns:
        set: Set of permission strings (e.g., {'books.book.read', 'books.book.update'})
        
    Raises:
        AttributeError: If user doesn't have 'roles' property
        
    Example:
        >>> user = User.objects.get(username='admin')
        >>> perms = calculate_permissions(user, Book)
        >>> 'books.book.read' in perms
        True
    """
    # Implementation
```

### Import Order

```python
# Standard library imports
import os
import sys
from datetime import datetime

# Third-party imports
import django
from django.db import models
from rest_framework import serializers

# Local imports
from .mixins import TurboDRFMixin
from .permissions import TurboDRFPermission
```
