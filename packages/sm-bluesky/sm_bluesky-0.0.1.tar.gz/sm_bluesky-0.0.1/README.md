# sm_bluesky

Bluesky code for Diamond's surface and magnetic materials beamline.

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

PyPI            | `pip install sm_bluesky`
Documentation   | <https://diamondlightsource.github.io/sm-bluesky>
Releases        | <https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/sm-bluesky/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from sm_bluesky import __version__

print(f"Hello sm_bluesky {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m sm_bluesky --version
```
