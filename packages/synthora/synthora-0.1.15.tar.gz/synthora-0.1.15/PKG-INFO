## ðŸ“– Introduction

Synthora is a lightweight, extensible framework for LLM-driven agents and ALM research. It provides the essential components to build, test, and evaluate agents, enabling you to assemble an agent with a single configuration file. Our goal is to minimize effort while delivering robust functionality.

> **Note:** This project is in its early stage of development. The APIs are subject to significant changes, which may introduce breaking updates. Use with caution and consider the risks associated with adopting an evolving framework. We welcome your feedback and contributions to improve this project together!

## ðŸ’¡ Core Features

Synthora offers a comprehensive suite of features designed to support your AI development needs:

- **Config-Driven Assembly:** Assemble agents and conduct chats with simple configurations.
- **Agents:** Includes various predefined agents (e.g., COT, TOT, ReAct) and supports custom agent creation.
- **Tools:** A comprehensive tool set is integrated for agents to call, unleashing the full power of agents.
- **Task Automation:** Employ powerful workflows to automate and streamline diverse tasks.
- **Multi-Agent Interactions:** Easily combine multiple agents using configuration files or straightforward code.
- **Extensibility:** Leverage a lightweight and highly extensible framework that integrates seamlessly with additional tools.
- **State-of-the-Art Workflows:** Align your work with cutting-edge AI research and practices.

## âš™ Installation

Install the Synthora Python Library from PyPI with a single command:

```shell
pip install synthora
```

## âœ¨ Quick Start

### Chat with an Agent

Engage in a conversation with a prebuilt Vanilla Agent:

```python
from synthora.callbacks import RichOutputHandler
from synthora.agents import VanillaAgent

agent = VanillaAgent.default("You are a Vanilla Agent.", handlers=[RichOutputHandler()])
agent.run("Hi! How are you?")
```

### Define a Tool

Create a simple tool to add two numbers using the provided decorator:

```python
from synthora.toolkits.decorators import tool

@tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    r"""Add two numbers together."""
    return a + b
```

### Build a Workflow

Construct a workflow that chains tasks together:

```python
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    return x + y

flow = (BaseTask(add) | BaseTask(add)) >> BaseTask(add)
flow.run(1, 2)
```

## ðŸ“ƒ Documentation

For detailed information on core modules, tutorials, and cookbooks, please visit our [Documentation](https://docs.syntropix.ai/en/latest/).

## ðŸŒŽ The Ecosystem

Synthora is a core component of the **Syntropix Ecosystem**, serving as the hub for our tech stack and community engagement.

We also offer a backend API platform, **Syntropix**, which provides a low-cost, efficient CPU-accelerated inference serviceâ€”the first of its kind in heterogeneous acceleration. Using Syntropix as your backend API in Synthora unlocks additional benefits:

- Detailed observability, analysis, and evaluation.
- Finer-grain control over inference services, including scheduled jobs.
- More advanced features and functionalities in the pipeline.
