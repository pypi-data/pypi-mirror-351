# canonicalwebteam.form_generator

Flask extension that generates unique HTML forms based on `json` data and registers them to URLs.

## Installation and usage

Install the project with pip: `pip install canonicalwebteam.form-generator`

You can then initialize it by passing a Flask app instance and path to the form template, and then load the forms:

```
from canonicalwebteam.form_generator import FormGenerator

form_template_path = "path/to/form-template.html"
form_loader = FormGenerator(app, form_template_path)
form_loader.load_forms()
```

You can then call the `load_forms` function from within a Jinja template. Providing a path for the `form-data.json` (required) and a formId (optional):

```
{{ load_form('/aws', 1234) | safe }}
```

## Local development

### Running the project

This guide assumes you are using [dotrun](https://github.com/canonical/dotrun/).

Include a relative path to the project in your `requirements.txt` (this example assumes both project exist in the same dir):
`-e ../form-generator`

Run dotrun with a mounted additor:
`dotrun -m /path/to/canonicalwebteam.form-generator:../form-generator`
