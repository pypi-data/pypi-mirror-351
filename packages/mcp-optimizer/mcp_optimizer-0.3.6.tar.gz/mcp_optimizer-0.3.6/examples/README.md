## How to Use These Examples

### For LLM Integration
These examples are designed to be used as prompts when interacting with LLMs that have access to MCP Optimizer. Simply copy the prompt text and provide it to your LLM.

### For Direct API Usage
Each example includes the corresponding API structure that can be used directly with MCP Optimizer functions.

### For Learning
Use these examples to understand different optimization problem types and how to formulate them for MCP Optimizer.

## Example Structure

Each example file contains:

1. **Description** - Overview of the optimization problem type
2. **Example Prompts** - Ready-to-use prompts for LLMs
3. **API Structure** - Technical implementation details
4. **Activation Phrases** - Common phrases that trigger optimization
5. **Applications** - Real-world use cases

## Language Versions

- **Russian (`/ru`)** - Examples in Russian with ruble-based scenarios
- **English (`/en`)** - Examples in English with dollar-based scenarios

Both versions cover the same optimization concepts and are direct translations of each other.
