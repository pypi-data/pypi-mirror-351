## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.5] - 2025-05-28

### Fixed
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Critical fixes for PyPI publishing and merge-back automation
  - Fixed PyPI publishing job failure due to missing package artifacts
    - Replaced unreliable GitHub release download with GitHub Actions artifacts
    - Added `upload-artifact` step in release job to preserve build artifacts
    - Updated `pypi-publish` job to use `download-artifact` for reliable artifact retrieval
  - Fixed merge-back job permission and authentication issues
    - Added missing `actions` permission for GitHub Actions operations
    - Added required `GH_TOKEN` environment variable for GitHub CLI operations
    - Implemented intelligent merge conflict resolution for workflow files
  - Enhanced merge-back automation with three-tier conflict resolution strategy
    - Primary: Merge with `-X ours` strategy (prefer main branch for conflicts)
    - Secondary: Standard merge attempt
    - Tertiary: Automatic workflow conflict resolution + manual issue creation for remaining conflicts

### Changed
- **Artifact Management**: Improved reliability of package distribution between CI jobs
  - Standardized artifact naming (`python-package-distributions`) across pipeline
  - Eliminated timing issues with GitHub release file availability
  - Reduced dependency on external GitHub CLI for artifact management
- **Merge Strategy**: Enhanced automation for release-to-develop merges
  - Automatic resolution of workflow file conflicts in favor of main branch
  - Detailed conflict reporting and resolution guidance in created issues
  - Improved PR descriptions with conflict resolution notes

## [0.3.4] - 2025-05-28

### Fixed
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Resolved PyPI publishing failures and simplified pipeline architecture
  - Fixed OIDC token retrieval failures (503 errors) by splitting publishing into separate jobs

### Changed
- **Pipeline Architecture**: Refactored release process for better reliability and maintainability
  - Split PyPI and Docker publishing into separate parallel jobs (`pypi-publish`, `docker-publish`)
  - Simplified `release` job to focus on core release tasks (tagging, GitHub Release creation)
  - Removed complex error handling and retry mechanisms in favor of manual job re-runs
  - Enhanced workflow summary to reflect new job structure and parallel execution
- **Job Dependencies**: Optimized job execution flow
  - `pypi-publish` and `docker-publish` jobs run in parallel after `release` completion
  - `merge-back` job runs independently of publishing jobs
  - Failed publishing jobs can be re-run individually without affecting other jobs

## [0.3.3] - 2025-05-28

### Fixed
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Fixed PyPI publishing with Trusted Publisher configuration
  - Eliminated unnecessary `github.ref_type != 'tag'` condition after removing tag triggers
- **Code Quality**: Improved workflow maintainability
  - Translated all Russian comments to English in CI/CD pipeline
  - Enhanced code readability and international collaboration support

### Changed
- **CI/CD Optimization**: Streamlined build job conditions
  - Removed obsolete tag-related checks from build job
  - Simplified workflow logic after tag trigger removal

## [0.3.2] - 2025-05-27

  - Consolidated `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `release-branch.yml`, and `auto-finalize-release.yml` into unified pipeline
  - Eliminated pipeline duplication and race conditions for release branches
  - Added smart job execution based on branch type (main, release/*, hotfix/*, develop, feature/*)
  - Implemented emergency release support with `force_release` and `skip_tests` options
- **Release Process Improvements**: Enhanced automation and reliability
  - Added triple-fallback release detection system (git branch analysis, version change analysis, commit message analysis)
  - Improved automatic merge-back to develop with conflict handling via PR creation
  - Added comprehensive release validation and logging
  - Enhanced release candidate automation for release branches
- **Development Tools**: Fixed version synchronization issues
  - Fixed `scripts/release.py` to automatically sync `uv.lock` after version updates in `pyproject.toml`
  - Prevents dirty git status after running `uv run` commands post-release
  - Added error handling for sync failures with graceful degradation

### Added
- **Unified CI/CD Pipeline**: Single pipeline handling all branch types and scenarios
  - Branch-specific job execution (test + security + build + release/release-candidate + merge-back)
  - Emergency release capabilities via workflow dispatch
  - Automatic release candidate builds for release branches with RC tags
  - Intelligent merge-back automation with conflict resolution
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Comprehensive pipeline and release process documentation
  - Updated `.github/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` with unified pipeline architecture
  - Added emergency procedures and debugging guides
  - Documented job distribution by branch type and detection methods

### Changed
- **Pipeline Architecture**: Streamlined from 3 separate workflows to 1 unified workflow
  - Improved resource efficiency and eliminated redundant executions
  - Centralized logging and monitoring for better debugging
  - Consistent behavior across all branch types

## [0.3.1] - 2025-05-27
