# Retail Network Optimization - Comprehensive Business Case

## Problem Description

Federal retail chain "MegaMart" with annual revenue of $5 billion faces serious challenges:
- Margin decline of 15% over the past 2 years
- Excess inventory of $800 million
- Inefficient product placement in 500 stores
- High logistics costs (12% of revenue)
- Suboptimal staff planning

**Goal**: Achieve ROI of 300-400% from optimization investments through comprehensive application of MCP Optimizer.

## Initial Data

### Network Structure
- **500 stores** in 85 cities across the US
- **50,000 SKUs** in assortment
- **15 regional distribution centers**
- **25,000 employees**
- **Annual revenue**: $5 billion
- **Current profit**: $250 million (5%)

### Problem Areas
1. **Inventory management**: excess $800M, shortage $200M
2. **Assortment policy**: 30% of products are unprofitable
3. **Logistics**: costs $600M/year (12% of revenue)
4. **Personnel**: 15% overtime, 20% idle time
5. **Pricing**: uncompetitive prices on 40% of products

## Task 1: Assortment Optimization

```
Use MCP Optimizer to optimize MegaMart's assortment.

```

**Expected result**: Logistics cost reduction of $180 million/year (from $600M to $420M).

## Task 4: Pricing Optimization

```
Help optimize pricing at MegaMart with MCP Optimizer.

Competitive environment analysis (1000 key products):

Product "Milk 3.2% 1 gallon":
- Our price: $6.50
- Average competitor price: $6.20
- Demand elasticity: -1.8
- Current sales: 2 million gallons/month
- Cost: $4.80

Product "iPhone 14 128GB":
- Our price: $850
- Average competitor price: $835
- Demand elasticity: -0.9
- Current sales: 500 units/month
- Cost: $750

[... data for remaining 998 products]

Constraints:
- Maximum deviation from competitors: ±5%
- Minimum margin: 10%
- Essential goods: maximum +2% above average price
- Loss leaders: must be below competitors

Maximize total profit considering demand elasticity.
```

**Expected result**: Profit increase of $120 million/year through optimal pricing.

## Integrated Optimization

```
Solve comprehensive optimization of entire MegaMart network with MCP Optimizer.

Combine all previous tasks into unified model:

1. Assortment matrix (50 categories × 500 stores)
2. Inventory levels (50,000 SKUs × 15 DCs)
