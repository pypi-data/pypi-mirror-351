# Guardian - Optimization Recommendations

## Overview

This document provides recommendations for working with the Guardian Mental Health Monitoring System's inference capabilities, particularly focusing on model loading and optimization across different environments.

## Current Status

The system currently supports multiple inference backends with intelligent fallbacks:

1. **PyTorch Backend** - Primary backend, most stable and compatible
2. **ONNX Runtime** - Improved performance, requires specific configurations
3. **TensorRT** - Highest performance, limited compatibility

## Recommended Approach

For most users and contributors, we recommend using the system with its default auto-detection capabilities:

```python
from mental_monitoring.utils.optimized_inference import OptimizedInference

# Initialize with automatic backend selection
engine = OptimizedInference()

# Analyze text
result = engine.analyze_text("I've been feeling sad lately")
```

This approach will:

1. Try to use the best available backend for your hardware
2. Automatically fall back to the most stable option if issues are encountered
3. Apply optimization techniques appropriate for your environment

## Model Loading

The system will automatically handle model loading issues by:

1. First trying to load the primary model path from config
2. If that fails, looking for a fixed version with the `_fixed.pt` suffix
3. Gracefully falling back to other formats if needed

## For Contributors

If you're contributing to the project, consider these guidelines:

### New Model Formats

When adding support for new model formats:

1. Ensure your changes maintain the fallback mechanisms
2. Add appropriate type handling for tensor conversions
3. Update the benchmarking code to test your added format

### Performance Optimization

When implementing optimizations:

1. Use the configuration system to make settings adjustable
2. Benchmark on multiple hardware configurations
3. Preserve backward compatibility with existing code

### Integration with Other Systems

When integrating with Discord or the dashboard:

1. Use the `OptimizedInference` class with default parameters
2. Let the system handle backend selection and optimizations
3. Focus on high-level functionality rather than low-level optimization

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with model loading or inference:

1. Run the diagnostic tool: `python check_model_status.py`
2. If model format issues are detected, use: `python fix_model_format.py`
3. For ONNX-specific problems: `python fix_onnx_format.py`
4. For general optimization testing: `python optimize_inference.py`

## Future Development

As an open source project, we welcome contributions in these areas:

1. **TensorRT Integration** - Complete integration with NVIDIA's TensorRT for maximum performance
2. **Model Quantization** - Implement INT8 and other quantization techniques
3. **Cross-Platform Testing** - Help test and fix issues across different hardware configurations
4. **Benchmark Suite** - Extend the benchmark suite to cover more scenarios

## Conclusion

The Guardian system is designed to be flexible and adaptive. Rather than forcing a specific optimization strategy, it intelligently selects the best approach for each environment, ensuring that the system works reliably across a wide range of deployments.
