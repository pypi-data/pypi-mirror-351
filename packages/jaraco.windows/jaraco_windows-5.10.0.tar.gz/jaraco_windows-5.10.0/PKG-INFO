A pure-python interface to Windows
APIs using ctypes. This package is not designed to be exhaustive, but
rather to supply interfaces as they are needed by the contributors.

Package Contents
================

``jaraco.windows`` contains several modules for different purposes. For now,
read the source. Eventually, I hope to put high-level descriptions of the modules
here.

Installation
============

You should install this module the normal way using pip.

If you want to monkeypatch the os module to include symlink compatibility, you
should add the following to your ``usercustomize`` or ``sitecustomize`` module:

	``import jaraco.windows.filesystem as fs; fs.patch_os_module()``

Thereafter, you should be able to use ``os.symlink`` and ``os.readlink`` in Windows
Vista and later using the same interface as on Unix.

Note that ``jaraco.windows.filesystem.symlink`` takes an additional optional
parameter ``target_is_directory``, which must be specified if the target is not
present and is expected to be a directory once present.

Contribute
==========

If jaraco.windows doesn't supply the interface you require for your
application, consider creating the interface and providing a pull request
to the project.
