# Protocol Call Stack Example (`protocol_call_stack_example.py`)

This page describes the `protocol_call_stack_example.py`. This script demonstrates how ETDI manages and enforces call stack constraints at the protocol level.

*Further details about call stack security features (max depth, allowed/blocked callees), how they are defined in tool metadata, their purpose in preventing attacks like privilege escalation, and how to run this example will be added here.*
