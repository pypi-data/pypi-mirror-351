Settings and preferences
========================

Hjelp requires mail delivery to be properly configured, as all three forms send their results via mail.
To set the individual mail addresses the results are then sent to, one preference for each form exists:

* **Recipient e-mail address for FAQ questions**
* **Recipient e-mail address for issue reports**
* **Recipient e-mail address for feedback**

Additionally, using another preference, it can be configured whether it is possible for anonymous users
to view the FAQ overview page:

* **Public visibility of FAQ**
