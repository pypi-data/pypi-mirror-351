Managing FAQs
=============

Each operator can and must write their FAQs on their own.
This is done on the page *Support â†’ Manage FAQ*. First of all, FAQ sections need to be created.
The form for this is accessible at the top of the page. For the section to be displayed,
the *Show* checkbox must be selected.

Afterwards, questions (including answers) can be created.
The corresponding section must be selected. Here, too, the *Show* checkbox is important.
The text in the answer field can be formatted using HTML.
All icons that can be selected are located on `Material Icons`_.

On the overview page, the order of the questions and answers can be changed.
In addition, the sections can be edited here. Hidden sections and questions are displayed darker.
