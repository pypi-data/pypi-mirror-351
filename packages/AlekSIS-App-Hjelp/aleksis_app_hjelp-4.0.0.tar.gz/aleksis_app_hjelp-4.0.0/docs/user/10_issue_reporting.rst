Reporting issues
=================

Using *Support → Report an issue*, users can report issues e. g. with AlekSIS or the school network.
To allow operators to fastly narrow down the issue, there is a three-level category system filled individually for each AlekSIS instance.
In addition to the category, the form asks for a one-line description and then a detailed description with additional information.
When reporting issues, please try to be as specific as possible – it will help your administrators. On top of the entered information,
the system will send your username together with the data.
