Reading Frequently Asked Questions
==================================

In the *Support* menu, administrators can add Frequently Asked Questions
concerning the AlekSIS instance, the local network, or something completely different.
These questions and their answers are accessible to all users under the *Support â†’ FAQ*.
If the system administrator enabled it, that might be also possible without login.
