# tini-editor 📝

**tini** is a minimal, terminal-based text editor built with Python's [curses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html) module. It's inspired by `nano`, but written in Python and designed for simplicity and speed.

## ✨ Features

- Open and edit any text file from the terminal
- Keyboard shortcuts:
  - `Ctrl+S` – Save
  - `Ctrl+Q` – Quit (prompts to save if file is modified)
  - `Ctrl+Z` – Undo
  - `Ctrl+Y` – Redo
  - `Enter` – New line
  - `Backspace` – Delete character to the left
  - `Delete` – Delete character to the right
  - `Arrow keys` – Move cursor
- Line numbers
- Undo/Redo history (cleared on save or exit)
- Automatic scrolling for both vertical and horizontal movement
- If the file doesn’t exist, it will be created when saved
