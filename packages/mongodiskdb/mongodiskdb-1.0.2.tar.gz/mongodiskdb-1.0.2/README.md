# MongoDiskDB

A MongoDB-style disk-based database implementation for Python applications. MongoDiskDB provides a familiar MongoDB-like interface while storing data locally on disk using the `diskcache` package.

## Features

- MongoDB-like document storage and querying
- Thread-safe operations
- Rich query language supporting `$and`, `$or`, `$gt`, `$exists`, `$nin` operators
- Flexible document schema within collections
- Sorting and pagination support
- Projection support to retrieve specific fields
- Data persistence across application restarts

## Installation

```bash
# Install the package
pip install mongodiskdb

# Load example data (either method works)
mongodiskdb example load
# or
python -m mongodiskdb example load

# Delete example data (either method works)
mongodiskdb example delete
# or
python -m mongodiskdb example delete

# Show available commands
mongodiskdb --help
# or
python -m mongodiskdb --help
```

## Web Viewer Interface

MongoDiskDB comes with a built-in web viewer that allows you to browse, query, and manage your database collections through a user-friendly interface.

### Starting the Viewer

```bash
# Start the viewer on default host (127.0.0.1) and port (5000)
python -m mongodiskdb viewer

# Start on a specific host and port
python -m mongodiskdb viewer --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Features

#### Home Page
![Home Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anandan-bs/mongodiskdb/main/screenshots/home.png)
- Lists all available collections in your database
- Shows document count for each collection
- Quick links to view or query collections

#### View Documents
![View Documents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anandan-bs/mongodiskdb/main/screenshots/view-documents.png)
- Browse all documents in a collection
- Documents are displayed in a paginated table
- JSON view for better readability
- Copy document content to clipboard

#### Query Interface
![Query Interface](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anandan-bs/mongodiskdb/main/screenshots/query.png)
- Write and execute MongoDB-style queries
- Support for complex queries using operators ($and, $or, $gt, etc.)
- Query results shown in real-time
- Export query results

#### Delete Documents
![Delete Interface](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anandan-bs/mongodiskdb/main/screenshots/delete.png)
- Delete documents matching specific query conditions
- **Important Security Note**: The default delete secret key is `mongodiskdb`. For production use, you should change this by setting the `DELETE_SECRET_KEY` environment variable:
  ```bash
  # Windows
  set DELETE_SECRET_KEY=your-secure-key

  # Linux/Mac
  export DELETE_SECRET_KEY=your-secure-key
  ```
- Confirmation required before deletion
- Shows count of matching documents before deletion

## Usage

```python
from mongodiskdb import DiskDB

# Get a database instance
db = DiskDB()

# Create collections
tasks = db.add_collection('tasks')
users = db.add_collection('users')

# Insert documents
tasks.insert_one({
    "task_id": "T123",
    "status": "pending",
    "priority": 1,
    "assigned_to": "john",
    "files": ["doc1.pdf", "doc2.txt"]
})

# Bulk insert
users.insert_many([
    {"name": "John", "role": "admin"},
    {"name": "Jane", "role": "user"}
])

# Complex query with AND, OR, and comparison operators
results = tasks.find(
    conditions={
        "$and": [
            {"status": "pending"},
            {"$or": [
                {"priority": {"$gt": 0}},
                {"priority": 0}
            ]},
            {"files": {"$exists": True}}
        ]
    },
    sort=[("priority", -1)],
    limit=10
)

# Print results
for doc in results:
    print(doc)
```

## Acknowledgments

MongoDiskDB is built on top of the excellent [diskcache](https://pypi.org/project/diskcache/) package, which provides the core storage functionality. Some key performance highlights from diskcache:

- Faster than other disk-based cache implementations like SQLite and LevelDB
- Sequential operations run at ~300 microseconds
- Bulk operations run at ~100 microseconds per operation
- Performance is stable with database size due to O(1) record operations

For detailed performance benchmarks and comparisons with other storage solutions, please refer to the [diskcache documentation](https://grantjenks.com/docs/diskcache/tutorial.html#performance-comparison).
