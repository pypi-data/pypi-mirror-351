- üìù **Markdown Processing**: Automatically processes markdown files and directories
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Configurable**: Flexible configuration via files, CLI arguments, and environment variables
- üîÑ **Batch Processing**: Process multiple files at once with progress tracking
- üìä **TSV Output**: Generates Anki-compatible TSV files for easy import
- üõ°Ô∏è **Robust**: Built-in error handling, retry logic, and validation
- üß™ **Well-Tested**: Comprehensive test suite with 100% coverage

## Quick Start

```

## How It Works

1. **Extract Content**: Anknote reads your markdown files and extracts the content
2. **AI Processing**: The content is sent to an AI model with a carefully crafted prompt
3. **Parse Cards**: The AI response is parsed to extract question-answer pairs
4. **Generate TSV**: Cards are saved in Anki-compatible TSV format for import

## Example

Given a markdown file like this:
