# PhotonKit

**PhotonKit** is a mildly opinionated, blazing-fast command-line toolkit for safely backing up and organizing your camera photos and videos. Designed for macOS photo wranglers, it reads EXIF metadata to group files by date and camera, prevents clobbering, and works seamlessly with both SD cards and massive archives.

- **Automated folder structure:** Organizes by year, date, camera, and file type.
- **Supports all major formats:** JPEG, HEIC, RAW (CR2/CR3/ARW/NEF), MOV, MP4, AVI, and more.
- **Resumable and safe:** Skips duplicates by default, or saves unique versions on demand.
- **Per-directory cache:** Re-scans are lightning fast, only extracting EXIF for new files.
- **Dry-run & date filtering:** Preview operations and filter files by EXIF date.
- **EXIF overrides:** Handles edge cases (like iPhone movies) using customizable rules.
- **MIT License:** Free for all personal and commercial use.

Perfect for anyone who wants to keep their photo archives pristine and searchable—no more messy folders or lost images.

## 🚀 Installation

**PhotonKit requires [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/) for metadata extraction.  
Install it first (macOS):**

```bash
brew install exiftool
```

Install PhotonKit via pip (after you’ve installed from PyPI or locally):

```bash
pip install photonkit
```

## ⚡️ How to Run
Basic photo backup:

```bash
photonkit \
  --source "/Volumes/SDCARD" \
  --target "/Volumes/PhotoDrive"
```

Dry run (see what would be copied, but don’t actually copy):

```bash
photonkit \
  --source "/Volumes/SDCARD" \
  --target "/Volumes/PhotoDrive" \
  --dry-run
```

Filter by EXIF date (only copy files dated on/after 2025-05-27):

```bash
photonkit \
  --source "/Volumes/SDCARD" \
  --target "/Volumes/PhotoDrive" \
  --min-date 2025-05-27
```

Allow duplicate file versions (IMG_1234-1.jpg etc):

```bash
photonkit \
  --source "/Volumes/SDCARD" \
  --target "/Volumes/PhotoDrive" \
  --skip-dupe false
```

## 🔎 Inspect EXIF Metadata

To print all EXIF metadata from a single file, plus camera model and original timestamp:

```bash
photonkit --exif /path/to/photo-or-video
```

## 📂 Example Target Structure
Your files will be organized like this:

```yaml
PhotoDrive/
└── 2025/
    └── 2025-05-27/
        └── canon-eos-r5/
            ├── jpg/
            ├── raw/
            └── video/
```


## 🛠 Features
Fast, safe, and resumable

Handles most camera/phone formats

Per-directory EXIF cache for speed

EXIF inspection mode with --exif

CLI output with progress and error reporting
