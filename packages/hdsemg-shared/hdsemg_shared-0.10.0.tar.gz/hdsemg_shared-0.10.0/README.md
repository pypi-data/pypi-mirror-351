Reusable Python components and utilities for high-density surface EMG (HD-sEMG) signal processing and input/output (I/O).

This module provides shared logic for HD-sEMG signal processing and file handling, used across multiple related projects, such as `hdsemg-pipe` and `hdsemg-select`. It is installable as a standalone Python package and is designed to simplify working with HD-sEMG data.

## 📦 Installation

This package lives inside a subdirectory (`src/shared_logic`) of a larger monorepo. It includes its own `setup.py` and can be installed directly via `pip`.

```bash
    python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip 
    pip install hdsemg-shared
```

## 🧪 Local Development

If you're actively developing or testing the module locally, you can install it in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e hdsemg-shared
```

This will allow you to make code changes without reinstalling the package.
