# nanoDT

*The simplest, fastest repository for training/finetuning medium-sized DTs.*

This repository is based on [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) and provides a lightweight implementation of Decision Transformers.

---

## Features

- **Lightweight and Simple**: Minimal dependencies and easy-to-understand codebase.
- **Continuous and Discrete Action Spaces**: Works seamlessly with both types of environments.
- **Customizable Models**: Easily configure model architecture and training parameters.
- **Dataset Integration**: Supports [Minari](https://minari.farama.org/) datasets for training.
- **Scalable Training**: Optimized for fast training on GPUs.
