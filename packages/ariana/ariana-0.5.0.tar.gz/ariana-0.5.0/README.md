Ariana is an IDE extension to understand what happens during runtime. You don't have to put `print()`, `console.log()` or breakpoints. Currently supports JS/TS & Python.

## ‚ú® Key Features

Use Ariana VSCode extension to :
- üïµÔ∏è Hover over any expression to see its **last recorded values**
- ‚è±Ô∏è See **how long** it took for any expression in your code to run.
- üßµ *Provide runtime history to* **coding agent** *for context-aware debugging* (WIP)

## üíæ How to install

| IDE | Command |
|-----|---------|
| **VSCode** | [Click here to install](vscode:extension/dedale-dev.ariana) or [get it from the marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dedale-dev.ariana) |
| **Cursor / Windsurf (VSCode Forks)** | [Download from open-vsix](https://open-vsx.org/extension/ariana/ariana) then drag the `.vsix` file into your extensions panel in Cursor/Windsurf... |

## üßµ How to use

Follow the **Getting started** instructions in the Ariana extension panel. Below is a summary of the process:

#### 1) - REQUIRED - Install the `ariana` CLI

The extension will install the required `ariana` CLI for you. In case it doesn't:

| Package Manager | Command                        |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| **npm**         | `npm install -g ariana`        |
| **pip**         | `pip install ariana`           |

#### 2) ‚ú® - REQUIRED - Add `ariana` just in front of your command. It will collect runtime information

```bash
ariana <run command>
```

For example:

| Codebase Type   | Command                                      |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **JS/TS**       | `ariana npm run dev`                         |
| **Python**      | `ariana python myscript.py --some-options-maybe` |


#### 3) üëæ Debug your code

Open the Ariana panel by clicking on the icon in the Activity Bar. Go to the **Analyze** tab and explore traces produced by Ariana.

- üó∫Ô∏è **Identify which sections of your code ran**


    | Highlight Color | Meaning                        |
    |----------------|--------------------------------|
    | üü¢ **Green**   | Code segment ran successfully. |
    | üî¥ **Red**     | Code crashed here. |
    | ‚ö™ **None**     | Code segment didn‚Äôt run or couldn't be recorded. | 


- üïµÔ∏è **Hover over any expression to reveal its past values**

  ![Demo part 2](https://github.com/dedale-dev/.github/blob/main/demo_part2_0.gif?raw=true)


#### 4) ü§ñ Use AI to recap what your code did & identify error root causes (WIP)

In the Ariana panel of your IDE go to Analyze and click "copy". You can then feed the traces to your AI coding agent in a little prompt like that:

```
<paste traces>

Using the debugging traces above and your knowledge of the codebase please do <xyz>
```

Tip: use an agent with a lot of contexts as traces are quite heavy for now.

*Coming soon: 10x smaller traces + an integrated coding agent for runtime questions / fixes*


----------------------------------------
## Preview : 

*To test Ariana before using it on your own code:*

```
git clone https://github.com/dedale-dev/node-hello.git
cd node-hello
npm i
ariana npm run start
```
