## Description

Given a list of bands and artists belonging to a musical movement, create a graph of memberships and collaborations using [networkx](https://networkx.org/) and render interactively with [ipysigma](https://github.com/medialab/ipysigma).

Data is stored in folder `data` and are text files with several rows, wach of them with the following format: `band;members;collaborations`. `members` and `collaborations` are lists of musicians or bands separated by commas `,`. `collaborations` includes collaborations between bands and musicians from other projects, and also between bands in songs or split albums. Most of info has been extracted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org), [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/), [Rate Your Music](https://rateyourmusic.com/), [Spotify](https://spotify.com/) and other sources.
