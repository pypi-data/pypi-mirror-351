# Multi-Particle Cryo-EM

This package is intended to function as the repository for data wrangling and analysis.

This package can use both CPUs and GPUs because of JAX.

Additionally, the package organization assumes that a POSIX compliant system is present *(Linux or MacOS)*. Ideally you should be running this in a Linux environment.

## Pre-Installation

These are directions on how to get your python environment ready for installation

#### Pyenv pre-installation

To get ready for installing the first time using [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):
```
git git@code.ornl.gov:intersect-em/particle_finding.git
cd particle_finding
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

This prepares your python environment for installation in the next steps

#### Conda pre-installation
To install for the first time using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):
```
conda create -n arm python==3.10
git clone git@code.ornl.gov:arm-inititative/multi-particle-cryoem.git
cd multi-particle-cryoem
```

## Installation

After pre-installation, these are the directions to install the `cryoblob` package.

```
pip install -e .
```
