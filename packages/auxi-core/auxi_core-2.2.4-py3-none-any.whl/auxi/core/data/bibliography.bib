  abstract     = {Ilmenite smelters must be operated with the slag bath contained in a freeze lining of solidified slag to prevent refractory damage and ensure feasible furnace life. This makes the process an interesting and challenging one to operate and control. The study focused on interactions between the freeze lining and slag bath. A mathematical model was developed to describe heat transfer, solidification and melting in the freeze lining and furnace wall. This model was incorporated into another model to yield a dynamic simulation-type model of the entire smelting furnace process. Simulation experiments with the models aimed to study the dynamic response of the freeze lining to changes in power input, slag composition, and operating parameters. Due to confidentiality considerations, it was not possible to incorporate industrial data for comparison into the study. Regardless of this, the results still remain useful to practitioners when considering the process aspects that were investigated.},

  abstract  = {Titania slag is used as feedstock in the production of titanium dioxide pigment. It (titania slag) is the product of ilmenite smelting, a process whereby ilmenite is reduced at high temperature utilization anthracite as reducing agent. Although various slag tapping configurations are employed throughout the ilmenite smelting industry, the method of tapping the slag from the furnace into bell shaped cast steel pots, was the subject of investigation in this study. The paper describes the formulation of a cooling model used to calculate and subsequently predict the temperature profile of a slag block during its cooling within the various cooling environments of pot cooling, air cooling and water cooling. The model was calibrated against actual internal slag temperature measurements and verified with information obtained from both pilot and industrial scale blocks.

  abstract    = {The technology of submerged-arc electric furnaces has been applied successfully in the non-ferrous metals industry.  However, there is a lack of understanding of the kinetics of this process mainly due to the complexities of the heat and fluid-flow field in the molten bath. In the present work, both physical and mathematical models were developed to understand the heat transfer and fluid flow occurring in slag-cleaning furnaces.  A one-tenth scale model of two-dimensional flow, in which molten wax simulated the liquid slag, was used for the physical model experiments.  It was found that the temperature field showed a strong thermal stratification in the main liquid body under natural convection conditions.  The heat transfer coefficients to the end wall were 150 to 180 W/m2K in the liquid and those to the base were only 20 to 25 W/m2K.  The introduction of a top thermal load changed the heat transfer and fluid flow of the wax model significantly,  by forming a relatively uniform temperature region below the top boundary layer.  The heat transfer to the base was much improved by gas bubbling near the heating block which simulated gas evolution at the electrode in a full-scale furnace. The temperature and velocity fields in the wax tank were solved using a software package, microCOMPACT.  In order to avoid numerical instability due to the high Ra number («1.3xl09) and low aspect ratio («0.5)  involved in the wax model, a fine grid and low underrelaxation factor were employed.  The computed results were compared with ex­ perimental results and showed satisfactory agreement.},

  abstract     = {This study focuses on the reuse of waste ferrochrome (FeCr) slag as a partial replacement for sand in the production of cement mortar with improved thermal and mechanical properties. Sand was replaced by FeCr slag in different percentages ranging from 0 up to 20\% (by weight). The flowability test was performed to evaluate the mortar’s behavior in a fresh state. Tests for the compressive strength, flexural strength, drying shrinkage, thermal conductivity, and specific heat of the blended mortars have been conducted according to ASTM standards at 3, 7, and 28 days of curing. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was utilized to examine the phase composition. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used for inspecting the microstructure changes of the hardened samples. The results revealed considerable improvements in the compressive and flexural strengths; improvement ratios of about 33 and 39\% were attained respectively at 20\% FeCr slag replacement after 28 days of curing. The drying shrinkage generally decreased with increasing replacement of sand by FeCr slag. FeCr slag acts to increase both the thermal conductivity and specific heat effectively. FeCr slag caused remarkable modifications in the microstructure of the blended mortars. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0002345. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Software that calculates the thermophysical properties of slags from chemical composition is available on the www.pyrometallurgy.co.za website. This paper outlines the principles underlying the various models available in the program. The software calculates the following properties of crystalline, glassy, and liquid slags (where appropriate) as a function of temperature: heat capacity, enthalpy, density, viscosity, thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and surface tension. We hope, in the future, to update the program to (i) add new models as they become available, (ii) remove any ‘bugs’ discovered in existing programs, and (iii) provide guidance on the limitations of individual programs.},

The long-term behaviour of this material is still little known, and the characterisation of large volume slag dumps remains an environmental challenge. In this study various analytical techniques are used to characterise Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) slag landfilled for several decades and exposed to chemical weathering and erosion. Coupling chemical, mineralogical and magnetic techniques helps to understand the relations between hazardous metals and mineral phases. A special interest is given to Fe-bearing minerals microstructure so as to link the magnetic properties of the material to its mineralogical composition. The studied slag presents high amounts of chromium (between 1 and 3 wt. \%) and very high magnetic susceptibility values (near 60 × 10−6 m3/kg), explained by the presence of magnetite and a spinel solid solution. Some correlations are found between magnetic susceptibility and potentially hazardous metals, providing new perspectives for future environmental investigations.},

The interest in the electrical properties of these slags originated from problems being experienced in the electrical control of the melter type furnaces of the platinum producers in South Africa. A large amount of literature on the electrical conductivity of slags was collected and analysed. The key research areas identified through the literature review were: the effect of iron oxide on slag conductivity in terms of ionic and electronic mechanisms, the effect of oxidation state on the conductivity of iron-containing slags and the effect of chromium on the electrical conductivity of melter type slags. Measurements of the electrical conductivities of various slags were conducted in order to gain an understanding of these effects.},

The thermodynamic properties of the slag phase were described by the cell model. The solid phases, such as spinel, olivine and pyroxene were modelling by using the regular type model. The viscosity and electrical conductivity of homogenous melts or melts containing solid particles were calculated by the CSIRO models. The models have been validated against new experimental data on synthetic and industrial slags. The inclusion of Cr in the database of the Multi-Phase Equilibrium (MPE) package has allowed its application to study behaviour of phases in electric smelting of sulphide concentrates containing low level of chromium and Platinum Group Metals (PGM).},

However, the distribution of manganese ores is significantly uneven on earth, and their characteristics considerably vary by ore type. It is known from experience that the production of highcarbon ferromanganese by the electric furnace method depends greatly on material ores. Therefore, to maintain stable operation in the electric furnace-smelting field, it is important to identify the characteristics of each type of material ores in advance. Thus, we evaluated the high-temperature electric characteristics of manganese ores using the electrical conductivity measuring system developed by ourselves and provided the standards for determining ores and blending ratio necessary for stable operation of the electric furnace based on the evaluation results.},

  abstract   = {This text discusses models which have been recently developed to represent physical (viscosity) and thermodynam ic (phase diagrams, component activities) properties of multicom- ponent iron- and steelmaking slags. For industrial applications, the development of such models is the necessary complement of basic experimental work on binary and ternary systems. Beyond equilibrium properties of homogeneous systems, comments are made on some of the aspects of slag benavior that are only poorly documented, e.g. the rheology of liquid+ solid slags. Applications of this information for the control of steelmaking operations are presented. The selected examples concern the protection of refractory linings by sfag coating of reactors walls, and the monitoring of actual steelmaking reactions in ladle metallurgy, and in inclusions control.},

  abstract   = {The surface tension for metastable austenitic Fe-16\%Cr-7\%Mn-6\%Ni as-cast stainless steel is investigated using the maximum bubble pressure and the sessile drop method. Sulfur content is varied from 0.01wt.-\% to 0.102wt.-\% S and phosphorous from 0.018wt.-\% to 0.216wt.-\% P. Fe-16\%Cr-7\%Mn-6\%Ni in varying S, P content are gas atomized using pure argon ({$<$}2 ppm) and close-coupled atomization technique. As a result, sulfur is a strong surface active element which results in a decrease of the surface tension of the investigated steels. Despite this, phosphorous is hardly decreasing the surface tension and is not found to be surface active in the CrMnNi steels. Finally in close coupled atomization, larger sulfur or phosphorous addition lead to finer grain sized steel powder. In both cases, the mass median particle size d50 of the modified steel samples decreases to ca. 25µm for P and ca. 15µm for S. As a conclusion, the decrease of d50 for sulfur alloyed steel is proportional to a decrease in the surface tension. The decrease of d50 for phosphor alloyed samples is not caused by a surface tension effect.},
