# FilenameParser configuration file
#
# General idea:
#
# The file contains the information required to build all the FilenameElement requested by the importer.
#
# Prepare a table for each element and in each table add the regexp, the type and optionally the default.
# Adding the default field, will make the element optional.
#
# Add the table name in the elements array. The order is irrelevant. The division in compulsory and optional elements
# is also irrelevant. It is provided here just for the sake of clarity.
#
# You can have as many element tables as you like, but only the one listes in the elements array will be used to
# configure the Importer.
#
elements = [
    # compulsory elements:
    'sample', 'energy',
    # optional elements:
    'repetition'
]
