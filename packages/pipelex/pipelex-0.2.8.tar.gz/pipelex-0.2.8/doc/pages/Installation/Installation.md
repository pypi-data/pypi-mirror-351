# Installation

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

Pipelex requires `python 3.11`, and access to LLM api keys, if you want to run pipelines locally, or an API key provided by Pipelex to use our cloud-hosted service.

## ðŸ§­ Getting Started

Everything you need to discover and test Pipelex is available in our **Getting Started repository**.
Along with [our Documentation](../Quick-start/Quick-start.md), we recommend you review it before any further usage: [Cookbook](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex-cookbook).

- **Install Pipelex using**

```bash
pip install pipelex
```

- **Make sure you have a .env** file at the root of your project that contains the following fields

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk_...
```

- **Make sure your project looks like this:**

```bash
<your_repo>
â”œâ”€â”€ pipelex.toml    # the config file for pipelex
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                          # the .env file to put your API keys and other pipelex variables in
â”œâ”€â”€ pipelex_libraries               # a directory to store your pipelex related code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
```
