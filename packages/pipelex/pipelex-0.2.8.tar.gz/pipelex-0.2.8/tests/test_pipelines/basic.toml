You are studying a contract. As usual, you are given a form to fill in about this contract.
Fortunately, you have a natural language based retrieval system that can help you recover useful, required, information.

Your task is to formulate a search query for the retrieval system based on the provided field and contextual information.

And here is the context about the contract:
{{ project_context|tag("context") }}

So here is the field to fill in:
{{ question|tag("field") }}

Write the query in a concise way, ensuring that you include the context for the retrieval system.
Reformulate the field if needed. 
Your answer will be directly used as the query to the retrieval system, so make sure it is usable as a query (do not add quotes, introduction text, etc.).

- if the question is 'Paul is 30 years old, John is half of Paul's age plus 20 years, who is older?', you should return 'a name'.
