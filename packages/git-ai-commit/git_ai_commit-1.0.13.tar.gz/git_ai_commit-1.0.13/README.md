Tl;DR

- AI that writes your commit messages.

- A CLI and git hook that summarizes your changes every time you run `git commit`.

- Integrates with the [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) framework, working alongside all your git hooks.

## üì∫ Usage

![Usage Demo](assets/videos/ai-commit-msg.gif)

`git-ai-commit` currently support the following LLM providers...

- **Open AI**: `gpt-4o-mini`(default), `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5`, and [more...](https://github.com/ming1in/ai-commit-msg/blob/a1e62be64c1f877bfa26c45d2d61508f94504ec0/ai_commit_msg/utils/models.py#L1)

- **Anthropic**: `claude-3-haiku`, `claude-3-sonnet`, `claude-3-opus`
  - [Wiki: Setup Anthropic Model](./wiki/anthropic.md)

- **Local Ollama**: `llama3`, `mistral`, `phi-3`, `gemma`, and [more..](https://github.com/ming1in/ai-commit-msg/blob/a1e62be64c1f877bfa26c45d2d61508f94504ec0/ai_commit_msg/utils/models.py#L1)
  - [Wiki: Using local Ollama LLM model](./wiki/ollama.md)

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Install the `git-ai-commit` tool via pip

```bash
pip install git-ai-commit

git-ai-commit --version # verify installation
```

2. Start configuring your tool

```bash
git-ai-commit config --setup
```

3. Your done, happy committing! Check out our fun range of command, the LLM can even help you, just run...

```bash
git-ai-commit help-ai [question?]

# or get help the ol fashion way

git-ai-commit --help
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start: Setup Git Hook

To quickly setup your [`prepare-commit-msg`](<https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_prepare_commit_msg>) git hook, execute the command below.

Caution, this will override any existing `prepare-commit-msg` hooks you may have. To coordinate multiple git hook, check out the [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) framework.

```bash
git-ai-commit hook --setup
```

That is all, your good to go! Now every time you run `git commit`, let AI present you with a commit message.

## ü™ù Integrate with `pre-commit` framework

`git-ai-commit` integrates easily with your other git hook using the `pre-commit` framework. Follow the instructions below to get set up.

1. Install the [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) git hooks framework

```bash
brew install pre-commit
pre-commit --version 
```

2. Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` files and add the following config.

```bash
touch .pre-commit-config.yaml 
```

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml 

default_install_hook_types: 
  # make sure you include `prepare-commit-msg` in `default_install_hook_types`
  - prepare-commit-msg
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/the-cafe/git-ai-commit
    rev: v1.0.13
    hooks:
    -   id: git-ai-commit
```

3. Based on the config above, install your `pre-commit` hook scripts.

```bash
pre-commit install 
```

4. Setup your OpenAI key, [see their docs for help](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart).

```bash
git-ai-commit config --openai-key=...
```

## üéØ Cursor IDE Integration

`git-ai-commit` integrates seamlessly with Cursor IDE to enhance your AI-powered development workflow. The tool works alongside Cursor's AI capabilities to provide consistent, high-quality commit messages.

### üìÅ Setup `.cursorrules` Integration

Add git-ai-commit to your project's `.cursorrules` file to ensure Cursor always suggests using AI-generated commit messages:

```markdown
# Git AI Commit Integration

## Commit Workflow
When making commits, always use the `git-ai-commit` CLI tool instead of regular `git commit`. This tool automatically generates AI-powered commit messages based on your staged changes.

### Recommended Commands:
- Use `git-ai-commit` instead of `git commit` for AI-generated commit messages
- Use `git-ai-commit conventional` for conventional commit format
- Use `git-ai-commit summarize` to get a quick overview of changes before committing

### Workflow Integration:
- Before committing, stage your changes with `git add`
- Instead of `git commit -m "message"`, simply run `git-ai-commit`
- The tool will analyze your changes and suggest an appropriate commit message
```

### üí¨ Example Cursor Prompts

Here are some effective prompts to use with Cursor when working with git-ai-commit:

**For committing changes:**
```
"I've made some changes to my code. Please stage the files and use git-ai-commit to generate an appropriate commit message."
```

**For conventional commits:**
```
"Stage my changes and use git-ai-commit conventional to create a conventional commit message for this feature/fix/refactor."
```

**For code review before committing:**
```
"Before committing, please run git-ai-commit summarize to show me what changes I've made, then proceed with the commit."
```

**For complete workflow:**
```
"Please help me commit my changes using this workflow: 1) Stage relevant files, 2) Use git-ai-commit to generate the message, 3) Review the commit message, 4) Push to the remote repository."
```

### üîÑ Recommended Workflow with Cursor

1. **Make your code changes** using Cursor's AI assistance
2. **Stage changes**: Ask Cursor to `git add` the relevant files
3. **Generate commit message**: Use `git-ai-commit` instead of manual commit messages
4. **Review and commit**: Let the AI analyze your changes and create descriptive commit messages
5. **Push changes**: Complete the workflow with `git push`

This integration ensures that both your code and commit messages maintain high quality and consistency throughout your development process.
