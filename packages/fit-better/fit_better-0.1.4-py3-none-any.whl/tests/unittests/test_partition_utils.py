"""
Unit tests for partition utility functions.

This module tests the core partitioning functionality of the fit_better package:
1. Loading and validating test data
2. Creating and validating partition boundaries using different algorithms (KMeans, etc.)
3. Training models on partitioned data with different partition modes
4. Verifying correct partition counts and minimum partition sizes
5. Handling edge cases like empty boundaries and small datasets

These tests ensure the partitioning functionality is robust and reliable across
different data distributions and configurations.
