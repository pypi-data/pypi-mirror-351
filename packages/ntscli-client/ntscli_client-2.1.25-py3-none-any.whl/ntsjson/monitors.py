        Handle updates for progress from the runner.

        This is a convenience function. The JSON payload is converted to a dict and passed to this function
        to save the clients from having to deal with all the assorted logic.

        This gets an MqttPacket - which is an object with attributes .topic and .payload.
        The payload includes the target, which is especially useful if testing multiple devices behind one RAE.

        The easiest way to deal with the payload is to convert it to an object:
        casted: StatusBody = StatusBody().from_dict(value=packet.payload)
            if casted.data.step is not None:
                myevent.set()

        'status' is nearly always one of these:
        running, pending, passed, failed, cancelled, invalid

        Additional fields will stop being None as they are populated by the test and Automator.
        Additional classes can be added to give you multiple abilities/outputs. Just remember they are not in threads,
        so don't do slow things. Set up your own threaded workers, etc. unlike what I do elsewhere in this sample.

        When the run is no longer active, you get one final update message.

        This gets an MqttPacket - which is an object with attributes .topic and .payload.

        The easiest way to deal with the payload is to convert it to a CloudStatus object:
        casted = CloudStatus().from_dict(value=packet.payload)
        The CloudStatus fields can tell you which device and where to download the full JSON report
        of the test plan.
