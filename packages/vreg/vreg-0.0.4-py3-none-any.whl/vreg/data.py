def fetch(dataset=None, clear_cache=False, download_all=False) -> vol.Volume3D:
    """Fetch a dataset included in vreg

    Args:
        dataset (str, optional): name of the dataset. See below for options.
        clear_cache (bool, optional): When a dataset is fetched, it is 
          downloaded and then stored in a local cache memory for faster access 
          next time it is fetched. Set clear_cache=True to delete all data 
          in the cache memory. Default is False.
        download_all (bool, optional): By default only the dataset that is 
          fetched is downloaded. Set download_all=True to download all 
          datasets at once. This will cost some time but then offers fast and 
          offline access to all datasets afterwards. This will take up around 
          300 MB of space on your hard drive. Default is False.

    Returns:
        Volume3D or list: Data as a vreg.Volume3D (for 3D scans) or a list of 
        Volume3D objects (for 2D multislice scans).

    Example:
        Fetch the kidneys mask and the T1-map, and display as overlay:

    .. pyvista-plot::
        :include-source:
        :context: 
        :force_static:

        >>> import vreg
        >>> import vreg.plot as plt

        Get the data:

        >>> kidneys = vreg.fetch('kidneys')
        >>> T1 = vreg.fetch('T1')

        Plot as overlays:

        >>> plt.overlay_2d(T1, kidneys)

    Notes:

        The following datasets can be fetched: 
        
            - 'Dixon_out_phase': A 3D coronal opposed-phase volume from a DIXON
              scan of the abdomen.
            - 'kidneys': A 3D mask covering the kidneys on the coronal DIXON 
              scan. 
            - 'left_kidney': A 3D mask covering the left kidney on the DIXON 
              scan. 
            - 'right_kidney': A 3D mask covering the right kidney on the 
              DIXON scan. 
            - 'MTR': A 3D magnetization transfer ratio volume with oblique 
              orientation aligned with the axis of the kidneys.
            - 'T1': A 5-slice 2D T1-map through the kidneys in oblique 
              orientations aligned with the axis of the kidneys.
            - 'T2star': A 5-slice 2D T2* map through the kidneys in oblique 
              orientations aligned with the axis of the kidneys.
