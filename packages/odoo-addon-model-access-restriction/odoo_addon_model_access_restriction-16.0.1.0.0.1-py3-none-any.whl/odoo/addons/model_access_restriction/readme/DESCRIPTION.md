This module adds a new model to configure Odoo permissions, the "Model Access Restrictions"

This model allows to restrict the access to a model for all users except the ones that belong to at least one group of a list of allowed groups. 

While Odoo's default access rules provide permissions, and having one already gives you access, these new rules remove them, and failing to comply with one restricts your access.
