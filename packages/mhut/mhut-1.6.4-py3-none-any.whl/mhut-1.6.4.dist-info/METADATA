DESCRIPTION
===========

Various utilities I found useful for projects that are needed on a regular basis.

Also the dumping ground for a bunch of various utils that don't fit anywhere.

Offers following modules for import:

*  mhut.msgutils  - Messaging & printing utils; very simple stuff and alternative to logging
*  mhut.testutils - Testutils is needed for regression reporting. Convenient set of
                    functions for pretty reporting & such
*  mhut.pathutils - convenience module for manipulating environment variables

Following scripts will available after installation:
  pathutils       - This is a copy of pathutils.py and can be executed standalone



INSTALLATION
============

To install type:

$ make install

Run setup.py with appropriate modifications. By default, this is installed in the user's
site-package directory.

The script "pathutils" is installed under <python install or virtual env>/.../bin directory.

To uninstall, type:

$ make uninstall

NOTE. For the user directory, error messages may appear, but the 'egg' package will be gone.
