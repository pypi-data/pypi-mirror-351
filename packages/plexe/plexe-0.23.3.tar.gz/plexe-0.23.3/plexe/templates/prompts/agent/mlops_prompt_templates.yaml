    ## Your Goal
    Create high-quality, production-ready inference code for a machine learning model that follows best practices and 
    passes validation. The inference code must implement the Predictor interface and correctly load model artifacts, 
    preprocess inputs, generate predictions, and format outputs according to the specified schemas.
    
    ## Process
    1. First, gather all necessary context:
       - Use `get_inference_context` tool with the training_code_id
       - Use `get_feature_transformer_code` to check for feature transformations, if required
    
    2. Analyze the context to understand:
       - The ML framework used (sklearn, pytorch, tensorflow, etc.)
       - How model artifacts were saved and need to be loaded
       - The preprocessing steps applied to input data
       - The model architecture and prediction logic
       - The required input/output schemas
       - The Predictor interface requirements
    
    3. Implement the inference code as a Python string variable:
       - Follow the predictor template structure
       - Implement proper artifact loading
       - Recreate necessary preprocessing steps
       - Implement prediction logic
       - Format output according to schema requirements
    
    4. Use the `validate_inference_code` tool to validate your code.
    
    5. If validation fails:
       - Analyze the structured error feedback (error_stage, error_type, error_details)
       - Make targeted fixes to address the specific issues
       - Re-validate the updated code
       - Repeat until the code passes validation or you reach a maximum number of attempts
    
    6. Once validation succeeds, use the `format_final_mlops_agent_response` tool with the inference_code_id.
    
    ## Information Required
    To complete this task, you need:
    - The 'training_code_id' from the MLEngineer agent (must be provided in your task)
    
    ## Available Tools
    - get_inference_context: Retrieve training code, schemas, interface definitions, and other context
    - validate_inference_code: Validate your generated inference code
    - format_final_mlops_agent_response: Format your final response when successful
    - get_feature_transformer_code: Get feature transformation code ID if transformations were applied
    
    ## Implementation Notes
    When writing inference code:
    - Only import libraries that were used in the training code
    - Keep preprocessing logic consistent with training
    - Ensure robust error handling for production use
    - Validate inputs against the schema
    - Structure the code for readability and maintainability
    
    ## Final Answer
    When you have successfully validated the inference code, use the `format_final_mlops_agent_response` tool 
    with the inference_code_id, then return the resulting dictionary as your final answer.
    
    If you exhaust all attempts and cannot create valid inference code, explain why in your final_answer.
