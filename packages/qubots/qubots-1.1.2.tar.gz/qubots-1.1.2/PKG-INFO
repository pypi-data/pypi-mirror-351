              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

**Qubots** is a powerful Python framework that transforms optimization problems and algorithms into shareable, modular components called "qubots". With seamless integration to the [Rastion platform](https://rastion.com), qubots enables collaborative optimization development, sharing, and deployment across domains including routing, scheduling, logistics, finance, energy, and more.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🔧 Modular Design**: Create reusable optimization components that work together seamlessly
- **🌐 Cloud Integration**: Upload, share, and load optimization models with the Rastion platform
- **🎯 Domain-Specific**: Pre-built optimizers for routing, scheduling, logistics, finance, energy, and fantasy sports
- **⚡ High Performance**: Integration with OR-Tools, CasADi, and other optimization libraries
- **📊 Benchmarking**: Built-in performance testing and comparison tools
- **🔍 Discovery**: Search and discover optimization models from the community
- **📚 Educational**: Comprehensive tutorials and examples for learning optimization

## 📦 Installation

Install qubots from PyPI:

```bash
pip install qubots
```

For domain-specific optimizations, install optional dependencies:

```bash
# For routing and scheduling (OR-Tools)
pip install qubots[routing]

# For continuous optimization (CasADi)
pip install qubots[continuous]

# For all features
pip install qubots[all]
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example showing how to create and solve an optimization problem:

```python
from qubots import BaseProblem, BaseOptimizer
import qubots.rastion as rastion

# Load a problem from the Rastion platform
problem = rastion.load_qubots_model("traveling_salesman_problem")

# Load an optimizer
optimizer = rastion.load_qubots_model("ortools_tsp_solver")

# Run optimization
result = optimizer.optimize(problem)
print(f"Best Solution: {result.best_solution}")
print(f"Best Cost: {result.best_value}")
```

### Creating Custom Optimizers

```python
from qubots import BaseOptimizer, OptimizationResult

class MyOptimizer(BaseOptimizer):
    def _optimize_implementation(self, problem, initial_solution=None):
        # Your optimization logic here
        solution = problem.get_random_solution()
        cost = problem.evaluate_solution(solution)
        
        return OptimizationResult(
            best_solution=solution,
            best_value=cost,
            iterations=1,
            runtime_seconds=0.1
        )

# Use your optimizer
optimizer = MyOptimizer()
result = optimizer.optimize(problem)
```

## 🌐 Rastion Platform Integration

Qubots seamlessly integrates with the Rastion platform for model sharing and collaboration:

### Authentication

```python
import qubots.rastion as rastion

# Authenticate with your Rastion token
rastion.authenticate("your_rastion_token_here")
```

### Loading Models

```python
# Load any available model with one line
problem = rastion.load_qubots_model("traveling_salesman_problem")
optimizer1 = rastion.load_qubots_model("genetic_algorithm_tsp")

# Load with specific username
optimizer2 = rastion.load_qubots_model("custom_optimizer", username="researcher123")
```

### Uploading Models

```python
# Share your optimization models with the community
my_optimizer = MyOptimizer()
url = rastion.upload_model(
    model=my_optimizer,
    name="my_awesome_optimizer", 
    description="A novel optimization algorithm for routing problems",
    requirements=["numpy", "scipy", "qubots"]
)
```

### Model Discovery

```python
# Search for specific algorithms
genetic_algorithms = rastion.search_models("genetic algorithm")

# Discover routing optimization models
routing_models = rastion.discover_models("routing")

# List all available models
all_models = rastion.discover_models()
```

## 🛠️ Creating Custom Optimizers

### Step-by-Step Tutorial

1. **Inherit from Base Classes**:
```python
from qubots import BaseOptimizer, OptimizerMetadata

class MyOptimizer(BaseOptimizer):
    def __init__(self, **params):
        metadata = OptimizerMetadata(
            name="My Custom Optimizer",
            description="Custom optimization algorithm",
            author="Your Name",
            version="1.0.0"
        )
        super().__init__(metadata, **params)
```

2. **Implement Optimization Logic**:
```python
def _optimize_implementation(self, problem, initial_solution=None):
    # Your optimization algorithm here
    best_solution = None
    best_value = float('inf')
    
    for iteration in range(self.max_iterations):
        # Generate or improve solution
        solution = self.generate_solution(problem)
        value = problem.evaluate_solution(solution)
        
        if value < best_value:
            best_solution = solution
            best_value = value
    
    return OptimizationResult(
        best_solution=best_solution,
        best_value=best_value,
        iterations=iteration + 1,
        runtime_seconds=time.time() - start_time
    )
```

```python
url = rastion.upload_model(
    model=MyOptimizer(),
    name="my_optimizer",
    description="My custom optimization algorithm"
)
```

## 📊 Benchmarking and Testing

Qubots includes comprehensive benchmarking tools:

```python
from qubots import BenchmarkSuite

# Create benchmark suite
suite = BenchmarkSuite()

# Add optimizers to compare
suite.add_optimizer("Random Search", RandomSearchOptimizer())
suite.add_optimizer("Genetic Algorithm", GeneticOptimizer())
suite.add_optimizer("My Optimizer", MyOptimizer())

# Run benchmarks
results = suite.run_benchmarks(problem, num_runs=10)

# Generate report
suite.generate_report(results, "benchmark_results.html")
```
