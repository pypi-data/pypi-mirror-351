## Installation

The package is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tieval/):

```shell
pip install tieval
```

It requires Python 3.8 or above.

## Usage

To understand its usability refer to the notebooks available [here]().

## Data

Throughout the last two decades many datasets have been developed to train this task.
tieval provides an easy interface to download the available corpus.

To know more about the module run the following code on the terminal.

```shell
python -m tieval download --help
```

## How to ...

In this section, we summarize how to perform the most useful operations in tieval.

### download a dataset.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from tieval import datasets

data_path = Path("data/")
datasets.download("TimeBank", data_path)
```

### load a dataset.

```python
from tieval import datasets

te3 = datasets.read("tempeval_3")
```

### load a model.

```python
from tieval import models

model = models.TimexIdentificationBaseline()
```

### make predictions.

```python
pred = model.predict(te3.test)
```

### evaluate predictions.

```python
from tieval import evaluate

annot = {doc.name: doc.timexs for doc in te3.test}
results = evaluate.timex_identification(annot, pred)
```
