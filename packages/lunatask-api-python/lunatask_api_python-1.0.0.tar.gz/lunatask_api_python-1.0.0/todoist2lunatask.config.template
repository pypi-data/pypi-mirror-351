# todoist2lunatask Config
#
# This is TOML, if you need help see: https://toml.io/en/
#
# You **MUST** set the following settings:
#
# - `todoist_api_token`
# - `lunatask_api_token`
# - `todoist_default_area`

###############################################################################
# You **MUST** change these settings.
#
# todoist2lunatask can't work without these being changed.

# You MUST change the todoist_api_token and lunatask_api_token values.
#
# To get your Todoist API token:
# https://www.todoist.com/help/articles/find-your-api-token-Jpzx9IIlB
#
# To get your Lunatask API token:
#
#  1. Click the Settings icon ⚙️ in the top left of the app window.
#  2. Click "Access tokens" in the Preferences list on the lef.
#  3. Click the "Create access token" button. Rename it to something like
#     "Todoist Import" so you don't forget what it's for. You should revoke the
#     token when you're done importing from Todoist.
#  4. Click the "Copy to clipboard" button and paste it here.
#
# **DO NOT** publish these tokens anywhere (a `git` repo, cloud storage, etc.);
# if you do, anyone could manipulate your Todoist and Lunatask data!
todoist_api_token = "TODOIST_API_TOKEN_GOES_HERE"
lunatask_api_token = "LUNATASK_API_TOKEN_GOES_HERE"

# You MUST set this to the Area ID of an existing Area of Life in Lunatask:
#
# 1. Under Tasks, select the Area of Life in the left panel.
# 2. Click the Settings icon ⚙️ in the top right.
# 3. Click Copy Area ID in the bottom-left of the dialog box.
# 4. Past the ID over `LUNATASK_AREA_ID_GOES_HERE`; the line should look
#    something like (your Area ID will be different):
#
#    todoist_default_area = "97b2b0ec-4d21-4b28-9510-962c103249f5"
todoist_default_area = "LUNATASK_AREA_ID_GOES_HERE"

# You *should* change these settings.

# These settings control the import process but aren't absolutely required.

# Project to Area of Life mapping
#
# Lunatask doesn't currently have a public API for creating Areas of Life; you
# must do this yourself **before** starting an import:
#
# 1. Create one or more Areas of Life. You can dump all of your Todoist tasks
#    into one Area, or you can map each Todoist Project into a separate Area
#    (recommended).
# 2. Get the Area ID from the area settings by clicking the "Copy Area ID"
#    button.
# 4. Use the todoist_project_map to map your Todoist project names to Area IDs.
#
# If a task's project can't be found in the todoist_project_map, it will be
# created in the todoist_default_area. If an Area ID is incorrect, the import
# will warn you, and create the task in the todoist_default_area instead.
#
# Creating this mapping is the most work you'll have to do during the import!
