**Kazm** is a fully modular AI game backend built in python for game developers who want to incorporate AI in their games without any hassle. 

Kazm ~~is~~ (will be) able to create quests based on rules you set, create and manage npcs with custom behavior, personalities and more

## ðŸš§ Work In Progress and Call For Help

Kazm is still in early development. I'm a beginner python developer with minimal experience in such projects, contributions are welcome and encouraged!

## Planned Features
- **NPC AI Behavior** â€“ Define personality, emotions, and decision logic
- **Dialog Engine** â€“ Create branching conversations with memory and tone
- **Quest Generator** â€“ Procedural quests based on world state and player actions
- **World State Manager** â€“ Track relationships, events, factions, etc.
- **API-Ready** â€“ Use Kazm with Unity, Unreal, or Godot via REST or WebSocket
- **Modular Design** â€“ Use only the systems you need
- And more is planned...

## TODO
- **More AI providers** - GenAI, OpenAI, Ollama, etc...
