        The run function for the generateQ Scheduler. The way it works is by using
        the forwardP function to generate a plan from the starting time to the end of the night
        but at each step it does this for the top K observations, and it chooses the observation
        that has the highest plan score at the end of the night. That would become the first
        observation of the plan. After each step it performs a Local Search Heuristic optimization
        that optimizes the order of the observation to minimize overheads.
        Then for the second it repeats the same process. It takes the top K observations runs
        forwardP until the end of the night, and assesses the plan score (but of the entire night,
        including the observation that was added before). It then chooses the observation that has
        the highest plan score at the end of the night, and that becomes the second observation of
        the plan. It repeats this process until the plan is full or it reaches the maximum plan
        length.

        At the end a final LSH optimization is run to maximize the score of the overall plan. This
        usually means reordering the observation to achieve a higher average airmass for the
        observations.
