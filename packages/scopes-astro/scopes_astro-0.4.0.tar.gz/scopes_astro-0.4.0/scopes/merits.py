    Time share fairness merit. It uses a modified sigmoid function to calculate the merit.
    The specific shape can be set with the parameters alpha and beta. The exact formula is:

    m = (delta / (1 + np.exp((pct_diff / beta) ** alpha))) + (1 - delta / 2)

    It's shaped in a way so that there is some permissiveness. This means that a program
    can be over or under the allocated time by a certain percentage before its priority is decreased
    or increased. The alpha parameter controls how sharp the sigmoid is, and the beta parameter
    controls how much difference is allowed (in percentage).

    Parameters
    ----------
    observation : Observation
        The Observation object to be used
    alpha : float, optional
        The attack parameter for how sharp the sigmoid is. Defaults to 3.

    Priority merit function. This is a fairness merit function to schedule based on priority.
    In this implementation it assumes that the priority values given is between 0 and 3, where
    0 is the highest priority and 3 is the lowest. This priority value is mapped to a base values
    for the priority level of 2, and then an offset is added above or below that base value depending
    if the priority is 3, 1, or 0. This is to convert this priority scale to something close to
    0 or 1 usually.

    The default values reflect a system where the program priorities are centered at 1, and then
    the target priorities are centered at 0 which work as a modifier to the program priority. This
    means that the priority of the program takes precedent, and then the priority of the targets
    help to decide within the program which targets to observe first. There is a small overlap,
    where a target with priority 0 can have a mapped priority higher than a target with priority 3
    of the next highest priority program. At this stage we don't have to worry that this generates
    more observations for the higher priority programs because that is balanced by the time share
    merit.

def culmination_efficiency(observation: Observation) -> float:
    """
    This merit is designed to make the scheduling of astronomical observations more efficient by
    expanding the selection of observable stars beyond those reaching their culmination (highest
    point in the sky) during the night. The normal Culmination merit misses out on stars that
    culminate before the night begins or after it ends, even though these stars are still
    observable at acceptable altitudes during the night.

    To address this, it uses an extended time range for calculating merits beyond the actual
    observable hours of the night. This extended range includes the earliest culmination point of
    any star still observable at the night's start and the latest culmination point of any star
    still observable at the night's end.

    This extended timerange is then mapped to the actual night time range where observations will
    be taken (typically within nautical or astronomical twilights). Its a simple one-to-one mapping
    between two different time ranges. Then to calcualte the merit, the time at which the star
    actually culminates is mapped from the larger timerange to the actual night range. That new
    mapped time is when that star will peak in this merit function.

    The method shifts observation priorities throughout the night—prioritizing setting stars early
    on, stars near their culmination around the middle, and rising stars towards the end. This
    method is a compromise between observing stars at their highest point but also giving priority
    to stars that are setting or rising.
