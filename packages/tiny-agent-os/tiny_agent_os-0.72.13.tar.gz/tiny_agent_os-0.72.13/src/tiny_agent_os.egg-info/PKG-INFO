# tinyAgent 🤖

![tinyAgent Logo](static/images/tinyAgent_logo_v2.png)

## ⚠️ Important Notice - Framework Evolution

**ReactAgent is now the recommended approach for new projects.** Going forward, ReactAgent will be the primary focus for development and new features. The simple agent (`tiny_agent`) and tinyChain will remain available for backward compatibility, but won't receive active development or new features.

**Why ReactAgent?**
- ✅ **Better reasoning** - Multi-step thinking with explicit thought processes
- ✅ **More reliable** - Built-in error handling and retry logic
- ✅ **Cleaner API** - No need to pass `llm_callable=get_llm()` anymore
- ✅ **Future-proof** - All new features will be added here first

---

# Why tinyAgent?

Turn any Python function into an AI‑powered agent in three lines:

```python
from tinyagent.decorators import tool
from tinyagent.react.react_agent import ReactAgent

@tool                  # 1️⃣  function → tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

agent = ReactAgent()                        # 2️⃣  tool → agent (LLM auto-configured!)
agent.register_tool(add._tool)
print(agent.run_react("add 40 and 2"))     # 3️⃣  natural‑language call with reasoning
# → "I need to add 40 and 2. Let me use the add function.
#    Thought: I'll call the add function with the two numbers.
#    Action: add
#    Action Input: {"a": 40, "b": 2}
#    Observation: 42
#    Final Answer: The result of adding 40 and 2 is 42."
```

- **Zero boilerplate** – just a decorator and register tools.
- **Built‑in LLM orchestration** – validation, JSON I/O, retry, fallback.
- **ReAct Pattern** – Advanced reasoning + acting pattern for complex multi-step tasks.
- **Scales as you grow** – add more tools without rewrites.

## Heads Up

tinyAgent is in **BETA** until V1. It's working but still evolving! I can't guarantee it's 100% bug-free, but I'm actively improving it whenever I can between my day job and business.  
Found something that could be better? Show off your skills and open an issue with a fix: I'd genuinely appreciate it!

---

## Overview

tinyAgent is a streamlined framework for building powerful, LLM-powered agents that solve complex tasks through tool execution, orchestration, and dynamic capability creation. Convert any Python function into a useful tool and then into an agent with minimal configuration, unlocking a world of scalable, modular possibilities.

---

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Install the Package

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install tiny_agent_os

# With observability features (recommended)
pip install "tiny_agent_os[traceboard]"

# With all features (RAG + observability)
pip install "tiny_agent_os[rag,traceboard]"
```

### 2. Get the Configuration Files

After installation, you'll need two configuration files:

```bash
# Create a basic config.yml
python -m tinyagent.config init

# Or download the example config directly
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alchemiststudiosDOTai/tinyAgent/v0.65/config.yml
```

Create a `.env` file with your API keys:

```bash
# Download the example .env file
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alchemiststudiosDOTai/tinyAgent/v0.65/.envexample -O .env

# Edit with your API keys
nano .env  # or use any text editor
```

### 3. Quick Start Example (ReactAgent - Recommended!)

```python
from tinyagent.decorators import tool
from tinyagent.react.react_agent import ReactAgent
from tinyagent.observability.tracer import configure_tracing  # For tracing support

# Define a tool
@tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

# Enable tracing (optional)
configure_tracing()  # This reads your config.yml

# Create a ReactAgent (LLM automatically configured!)
agent = ReactAgent()
agent.register_tool(add._tool)

# Run it with reasoning!
result = agent.run_react("add 40 and 2")
print(result)  # → Shows the reasoning process and final answer: 42
```

### 4. ReactAgent Pattern (RECOMMENDED!)

For complex multi-step reasoning tasks, use the ReactAgent. The framework automatically tells the LLM about available tools, and the LLM is pre-configured from your config.yml:

```python
from tinyagent.react.react_agent import ReactAgent
from tinyagent.decorators import tool

# Define tools - any function name works!
@tool
def calculate(expression: str) -> float:
    """Evaluate a mathematical expression."""
    return eval(expression)

@tool
def add_numbers(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """Add two numbers together."""
    return a + b

# Create ReactAgent - LLM automatically configured from your config.yml
agent = ReactAgent()
agent.register_tool(calculate._tool)
agent.register_tool(add_numbers._tool)

# Run with reasoning steps - no LLM setup needed!
result = agent.run_react(
    query="If I have 15 apples and give away 40%, how many do I have left?",
    max_steps=5
)
print(result)  # → "You have 9 apples left."
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Automatic tool discovery** - Framework tells LLM about available tools
- ✅ **No "Unknown tool" errors** - LLM uses exact tool names from registration  
- ✅ **Zero configuration** - Just register tools and run
- ✅ **Built-in LLM** - Uses your config.yml settings automatically
- ✅ **Multi-step reasoning** - Handles complex queries requiring multiple tool calls
- ✅ **Clean API** - No need for `llm_callable=get_llm()` boilerplate

### 5. Legacy Simple Agent (Still Supported)

For simple use cases, the original pattern still works:

```python
from tinyagent.decorators import tool
from tinyagent.agent import tiny_agent

@tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

agent = tiny_agent(tools=[add])
result = agent.run("add 40 and 2")
print(result)  # → 42
```

---

## Post-Installation Configuration

After installing (either via pip or from source), remember to configure your environment and `.env` files with relevant API keys from https://openrouter.ai

Both the config.yml and env work out of the box with a openrouter API, you can use any openai API, and the config has an example of a local LLM.
The /documentation folder has more details and is being updated.

## Features

- **Modular Design:** Easily convert any function into a tool.
- **ReactAgent Pattern:** Built-in support for Reasoning + Acting pattern for complex multi-step reasoning tasks.
- **Flexible Agent Options:** Use ReactAgent (recommended) or the simple orchestrator.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Improved debugging with custom exceptions and JSON parsing.
- **Structured Output:** Enforce JSON formats for consistent outputs.
- **Comprehensive Observability:** Built-in OpenTelemetry tracing with multiple exporters (console, OTLP, SQLite) and a web-based trace viewer.
