## Quickstart

The easiest way to use the package is as a
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) tool.

First, you should ensure that you have a `.env` file in your current working directory
with the following content:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-google-api-key>
```

You can then start writing documents using the following command:

```bash
uvx write-a-thing <your-prompt> [-f <file-to-use-in-document>] [-f <another-file-to-use-in-document>]
```

This both installs the package and runs the command. You can also replace
`GEMINI_API_KEY` with, e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, but then you will need to change the LLM
model used with the `--model` option when running the command.

You can see all available arguments by running the following command:

```bash
uvx write-a-thing --help
```
