# Hex API CLI

The Hex API SDK includes a command-line interface (CLI) for managing projects and runs directly from your terminal.

## Installation

Install the SDK with CLI dependencies:

```bash
pip install hex-toolkit[cli]
# or with uv
uv pip install hex-toolkit[cli]
```

## Configuration

Set your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export HEX_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

Optionally, set a custom API base URL:

```bash
export HEX_API_BASE_URL="https://custom.hex.api"
```

## Features

### Rich Terminal Output

The CLI uses Rich for beautiful terminal output including:

- Colored output for better readability
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Formatted tables for list views
- Syntax highlighting for JSON responses

### Auto-completion

The CLI supports shell auto-completion. To enable it:

```bash
hex --install-completion
```

### Custom Columns

The `projects list` command supports customizable columns via the `--columns` option:

**Available columns:**

- `id` - Project ID
- `name` - Project name
- `status` - Project status
- `owner` - Owner email address
- `created_at` - Creation date
- `creator` - Creator email address
- `last_viewed_at` - Last time the project was viewed
- `app_views` - Total number of app views (all time)

**Default columns:** id, name, status, owner, created_at

```bash
# Show only ID and name
hex projects list --columns id,name

# Include creator and analytics data
hex projects list --columns id,name,creator,last_viewed_at,app_views
```

### Search Functionality

The `projects list` command includes a powerful search feature:

```bash
# Search for projects by name or description (case-insensitive)
hex projects list --search "dashboard"

# Combine search with other filters
hex projects list --search "analytics" --include-archived --owner-email data@example.com

# Search with custom sorting
hex projects list --search "report" --sort -last_edited_at

# Search with custom columns
hex projects list --search "metrics" --columns id,name,status,last_viewed_at
```

**Note:** The search feature fetches all available projects and filters them locally. This ensures comprehensive results but may take longer for workspaces with many projects. The progress indicator will show the number of matches found as it searches.

### Pagination

List commands support pagination:

```bash
# Show first 50 projects
hex projects list --limit 50

# List runs with offset
hex runs list PROJECT_ID --limit 10 --offset 20
```

### Error Handling

The CLI provides clear error messages with trace IDs for debugging:

```
[red]API Error: Forbidden: You are not authorized to perform this action. (Status: 403) (Trace ID: abc123)[/red]
```

## Examples

### Running a Project and Waiting for Completion

```bash
# Run a project and wait for it to complete
hex projects run PROJECT_ID --wait --poll-interval 5
```

### Filtering Projects by Owner

```bash
# List all projects owned by a specific user
hex projects list --owner-email owner@example.com --limit 100
```

### Getting Detailed Run Information

```bash
# Get run status with formatted output
hex runs status PROJECT_ID RUN_ID
```

Output:

```
Run Status
Run ID: abc123
Project ID: xyz789
Status: COMPLETED
Started: 2024-01-01T10:00:00
Ended: 2024-01-01T10:05:00
```
