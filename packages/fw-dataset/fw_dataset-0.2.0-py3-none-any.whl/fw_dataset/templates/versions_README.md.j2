# Dataset Versions

This directory represents the archived versions of the dataset. Each version is
contained in a separate subdirectory named with the BSON version identifier (e.g.
"66cf6701af1c6f3855f1ee61"). 

The structure described below is more fully described in the
[Dataset Definition](../../docs/Dataset_Definition.md)
Document.

The version subdirectories contain the following files:

## `provenance/`

This directory contains the provenance metadata for the dataset version. The provenance
includes the following files:

- `README.md`: A description of this version of the dataset in a human-readable format.
- `dataset_description.json`: A JSON file containing the dataset description metadata.
    - This file is a JSON representation of the `Dataset` object from the `fw_dataset`
      package.
- `snapshot.db.gz`: A gzipped-compressed snapshot of the dataset in a SQLite database
file.
- `snapshot.json`: A JSON file containing the dataset snapshot in JSON format.
- `project.json`: A JSON file containing the project metadata for the dataset.
- `rendering.log`: A log file containing the output of the dataset rendering process.

## `tables/`

This directory contains the partitioned parquet files that represent the table data for
a specific version of the dataset.

## `schemas/`

This directory contains the JSON schema files that describe the structure of the tables
in the dataset. The schema files follow the 
[GA4GH Data Connect Table](https://github.com/ga4gh-discovery/data-connect/blob/develop/TABLE.md#table)
schema format.

## `profiles/`

This directory contains the JSON profile files that describe statistical profiles of the
tables in the dataset.
