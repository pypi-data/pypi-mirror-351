# dynamic_parser

`dynamic_parser` is a Python package that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently parse, correct, and structure malformed or unstructured JSON data. Itâ€™s perfect for situations where traditional parsers fail due to inconsistent formatting, missing fields, or syntax errors.
