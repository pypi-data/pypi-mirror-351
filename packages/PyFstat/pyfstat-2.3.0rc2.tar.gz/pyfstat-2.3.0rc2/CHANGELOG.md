 - Enabled support for python 3.13 and numpy 2.0.


## 2.2.1 [24/02/2025]

 - Fixed some detection statistic / output values corner cases.
   - E.g. in case the user wants `twoFX` (via `singleFstats` option), but not `BSGL`.
   - This includes fixes for regressions in 2.2.0.
 - Added `t0_MP` and `tau_MP` max-posterior estimates in transient outputs,
   following lalpulsar conventions.
   - Correspondingly, renamed the max-likelihood values to `t0_ML` and `tau_ML`.
 - Added support for `BtSG` detection statistic in `SearchOverGridFile`.
 - Improved logging of grid search classes.
 - Added `utils.translate_keys_to_lal()` function.

## 2.2.0 [08/01/2025]

 - Changed the core F-stat functions to alternatively take parameter-space points as dictionaries.
   The old individual arguments are still supported, but deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
 - Added new function `utils.plot_spectrogram`.
 - Added support for spindown orders >3 in Writer and search classes (up to `lalpulsar.PULSAR_MAX_SPINS`).
 - Added SearchOverGridFile class that can read a grid file following the format of `lalpulsar_ComputeFStatistic_v2`.
 - Some internal refactoring of code between mcmc, grid and core classes.
 - Updated various dependencies, mostly for developers.
 - Pinned chainconsumer dependency to <1.0.
 - Added codespell to pre-commit hooks.
 - Fixed some deprecations and code-formatting issues.
 - Extended tests.
 - Changed tutorial notebooks plotting from pcolorfast to pcolormesh.

## 2.1.0 [04/07/2024]

 - for developers: upgraded to black 24 style,
   refactored and updated the github actions

## 2.0.2 [12/10/2023]

 - Pinned to python<3.12 until more dependencies are updated
   and a few things fixed on our end.

## 2.0.1 [11/10/2023]

 - Fixed compatibility with matplotlib=3.8 and bumped minimum requirement to >=3.3.
 - Fixed pulling in ephemerides via lalpulsar optional dependency.
 - Fixed line simulation in "generating noise" tutorial.
 - Fixed some type checks to conform to flake8>=1.7 standards.
 - PyPI uploads now done using "trusted publishing" (OIDC).

## 2.0.0 [18/04/2023]

 - This is a major release of PyFstat in the sense that
   users will likely have to make some changes to the way they call it,
   but mostly just regarding class instance labels / file naming.
 - Mainly, we follow the recent `lalpulsar` upgrade to v3 of the SFT file format specification
   (see https://dcc.ligo.org/T040164-v2/public
    and note the v2 in the URL is not a typo,
    this file version describes both the v2 and v3 specifications).
   - We now require `lalsuite>=7.13`.
   - The file format update itself is fully backwards compatible:
     the only change is including window information in the header,
     which however reuses existing padding bytes, and hence does not affect compatibility.
   - The file naming convention however has become more restrictive:
     SFT files, and hence `label` arguments for `Writer` and derived classes,
     now may only contain ASCII alphanumerical characters,
     which specifically makes the old PyFstat habit of using underscores illegal.
     We suggest CamelCase instead.
   - Instead of `SFTWindowBeta`, one must now use `SFTWindowParam`.
   - `noiseSFTs` no longer requires `SFTWindow[Beta/Param]`,
     only if a window specification cannot be read from the headers of input SFTs.
 - Fixed an error that prevented one parameter to be printed in search output file header comments.
 - Fixed compatibility with `corner=2.2.2`.
 - Removed `utils.get_lal_exec()`, now always expect executables to be named `lalpulsar_`.
   (Old LALSuite versions with `lalapps_` CW executables are quite outdated by now.)
 - Removed deprecated prior formats in `InjectionParametersGenerator` class.
 - Transient F-stat GPU implementation:
   - Introduced F-stat condition number check,
     with threshold equivalent to defaults of
     `XLALComputeAntennaPatternSqrtDeterminant()`
     and `estimateAntennaPatternConditionNumber()`.
   - Now falls back to F=2 (2F=4) if Ddinv=0,
     also equivalent to `lalpulsar`.
   - Added unit tests.
   - Improved CUDA device info logging.
 - For developers: updated coding style to `black` 23.1.0 rules
   (mostly newlines policy).

## 1.19.1 [19/12/2022]

 - Pinned to `numpy<1.24.0` to avoid incompatibility with `ptemcee`.

## 1.19.0 [01/12/2022]

 - This is the first PyFstat release to officially support python 3.11.
 - LALSuite is introducing an SFT specification and filename update
   - see https://dcc.ligo.org/T040164-v2/public)
   - This version of PyFstat is pinned to `lalsuite<=7.11` (or `lalpulsar<6.0`)
     so that it is ensured to keep working with the old convention.
   - Next PyFstat release will adapt to the LALSuite changes.
   - Added `get_official_sft_filename()` utility function to ease migration.
 - Improvements to `injection_parameters` module with new priors logic
   (see documentation);
   old input style still supported for now but deprecated.
 - `Writer`: improved timestamps handling:
   support 1-column format (without nanoseconds),
   which has been the LALPulsar default for a while.
 - Changed `ComputeFstat.write_atoms_to_file()` method
   to use consistent `%%` comment markers.
 - Fixed segfault in `get_semicoherent_single_IFO_twoFs()` with recent LALSuite
   (need to properly copy FstatAtomVector struct).
 - Fixed `TransientGridSearch` when not setting any actual transient parameters.
 - Added (h0,cosi)<->(aplus,across) functions to `utils.converting`.
 - Added `utils.atom` submodule with tools related to F-stat atoms.
 - `utils.get_sft_as_arrays()` now user-accessible
 - `Writer`: warning about inferring parameters (in `noiseSFTs is not None` case)
   downgraded to info message
 - improvements to documentation and test suite

## 1.18.1 [03/10/2022]

 - fixed finalizer setup for calling `ComputeFstat` and its children
   in context-manager mode
 - reverted "walrus operators" (`:=`) and use of `Literal` typing checks
   to facilitate `python 3.7` backwards compatibility
   (not officially supported from release, but can be easily restored on branches / local clones)
 - lalsuite-from-source install instructions no longer included in README, now live on wiki
 - fixed logging use in examples
 - improved testing of tutorial notebooks

## 1.18.0 [06/09/2022]

 - refurbished logging system:
   - on `import.pyfstat`, stdout logging at INFO level is activated
     unless there are already handlers attached to the root logger
   - recommended to further call `pyfstat.set_up_logger` and define an output log file,
     as demonstrated in our examples
   - see https://pyfstat.readthedocs.io/en/v1.18.0/pyfstat.html#module-pyfstat.logging for details
   - removed the last global argparse options `--quite` and `--verbose`,
     along with the remainders of the `helper_functions.set_up_command_line_arguments()` function.
     Please use `pyfstat.set_up_logger` instead to determine verbosity level.
   - tests now by default print all >=WARNING messages even for passing cases
     and full >=INFO for failing cases
   - improved handling of LALSuite executables through `run_commandline`
     - better stderr/stdout capture
     - return is now either a `subprocess.CompletedProcess` object
       or `None`
     - default is now `return_output=False`
     - `log_level` argument removed
       (please use `pyfstat.set_up_logger` instead)
   - capture and handling of output from SWIG-wrapped LALSuite functions
     likely to be further improved in future versions
 - refactored `helper_functions` module into `utils` subpackage
   with multiple source files;
   - user can access all functions directly as `utils.some_function`
     without worrying about the level one further down
   - moved `matplotlib` setup into new `utils.safe_X_less_plt()`
   - removed deprecated/unused helper functions
        - `get_peak_values`
        - `get_comb_values`
        - `get_sft_array`
 - can install with `NO_LALSUITE_FROM_PYPI` environment variable,
   e.g. to avoid duplication of dependencies from conda and pip
   (now used this way in recommended `pyfstat-dev.yml`)
 - removed `peakutils` dependency
 - optional `[dev]` set of dependencies now also includes `docs` dependencies
 - added `sphinx_autodoc_typehints` to  `docs` dependencies
   and updated pinned versions of other sphinx packages
 - `DetectorStates`: fixed passing plain lists as values of a `timestamps` dict

## 1.17.0 [26/08/2022]

 - dropped python 3.7 support
 - dropped dependency on `lalapps` and now requiring `lalpulsar>=5.0.0` instead,
   where LALSuite executables now live
   (corresponding to `lalsuite>=7.7`)
   - there is a `get_lal_exec()` helper function to still allow running
     on old installations where the executables live in `lalapps`
 - removed most of the old package-level hardcoded `argparse` options,
   this should reduce conflicts when users import it in their own caller scripts:
   - `--clean` to be given as an argument to supporting classes
   - `-N` to be given as class argument `num_threads`
     to the one class `FrequencyModulatedArtifactWriter` that supported it
   - `--setup-only` and `--no-template-counting` to be given as class arguments
     to the (now deprecated) `MCMCFollowUpSearch`
   - `--no-interactive` was not supported anywhere
 - LaTeX no longer enabled for plotting by default
 - removed `bashplotlib` dependency and SFT timestamps ASCII art
 - removed fallbacks in case `tqdm` is not available,
   which is a dependency anyway
 - `snr` class: fixed behaviour when instantiating with a dictionary of timestamps
 - removed old backwards compatibility code from `FrequencyModulatedArtifactWriter`
 - developers: updated pre-commit hooks

   (transient Bayes factor from PGM2011)
 - `pyTransientFstatMap` is now available via `import pyfstat`
 - some refactoring of internal detection statistics functions
 - use of `lalapps_tconvert` replaced by new `gps_to_datestr_utc()` helper function
   (which uses `XLALGPSToUTC` and `datetime`)
 - fix CUDA context detaching at garbage collection time for
   `ComputeFstat` and `TransientGridSearch` classes
   - using `weakref`
   - should not require any caller code changes in standard use cases
   - but if user wants to initiate more than one such object from one session/script,
     these should be used in context manager style (`with ComputeFstat as` etc)
 - remove redundant complex entries from output of `tcw_fstat_map_funcs.reshape_FstatAtomsVector()`
 - streamline installation instructions for developers
   and remove single-use helper bash scripts

 - added `SignalToNoiseRatio` class (equivalent to `lalapps_PredictFstat`)
   and `DetectorStates` helper class in new `snr` module
 - ` InjectionParametersGenerator` and its children moved
   to separate module `injection_parameters`
 - `Writer` (and its children) now accepts `timestamps`
   as a list, dict over detectors,
   or comma-separated string of files per detector
   (`timestampsFiles` input is now deprecated)
