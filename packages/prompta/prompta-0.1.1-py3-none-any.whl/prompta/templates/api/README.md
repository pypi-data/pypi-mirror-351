# Prompta API Template

This directory is copied verbatim when you run

    prompta createproject <project-name>

The goal is to provide a _minimal_ yet working FastAPI backend that the CLI
can talk to out-of-the-box.  It is **not** intended to be feature-complete.

Structure:

```
{{project-root}}
├── app/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── main.py        ← FastAPI application lives here
├── .env               ← generated by the CLI (contains SECRET_KEY, …)
└── README.md          ← this file
```

After the CLI has scaffolded a project you can start a development server with

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn[standard]
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Feel free to customise the generated project as needed for your use-case.
