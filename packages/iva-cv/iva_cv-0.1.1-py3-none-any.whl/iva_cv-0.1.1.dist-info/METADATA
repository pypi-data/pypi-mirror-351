# iva-cv

`iva-cv` is a Python package that provides a **custom build of OpenCV** with enhanced support for **FFmpeg (H.264/H.265)** and **GStreamer**.  
This package allows easy installation of a pre-built OpenCV version, while requiring certain system-level dependencies to be pre-installed.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Custom OpenCV build with:
  - FFmpeg (H.264/H.265 codec) support
  - GStreamer support for high-quality video streaming
- Compatible with Linux and macOS (as of now)
- Packaged as a Python wheel for easy `pip install`

---

## ⚙️ System Prerequisites

Before installing `iva-cv`, ensure the following system libraries are installed:

### 📹 FFmpeg
- Must include codecs: **H.264, H.265**
- Install on Ubuntu/Debian:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install ffmpeg libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev

#### Verify installation:
 ```bash
    ffmpeg -codecs | grep -E "h264|hevc"
 ```

### 🎥 GStreamer
Required for high-quality video streaming support
 - Install on Ubuntu/Debian:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev \
    gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-libav
    ```
- Verify installation
    ```bash
    gst-inspect-1.0 --version
    ```

### 📦 Installation
- 1️⃣: Install Prerequisites (as above)

- 2️⃣: Install iva-cv Python Package
     ```bash
     pip install iva-cv
     ```
    - Or directly from a wheel file [if you have it]
    ```bash
        pip install iva_cv-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
    ```

### 🧪 Basic Usage
```bash
    import iva_cv as cv2
    print(cv2.__version__)
    print(cv2.getBuildInformation())
```

### 🐞 Troubleshooting
- cv2 module not found --> Ensure you installed iva-cv in your virtual environment or system.
- FFmpeg or GStreamer errors --> Double-check that system dependencies are installed and include H.264/H.265 codecs.
- Symbolic link or path issues --> Some installations might require adding /usr/local/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
