class SimParams:
    """A class to store simulation parameters.

    This data class stores the parameters of the tank at the start of the
    simulation as well as the conditions specified to stop the simulation.
    Additionally, it also stores the setting for the number of data points
    to be reported at the end of the simulation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    init_temperature : float
        The temperature (K) of the tank being simulated at the beginning of
        the simulation.

    init_pressure : float, optional
        The pressure of the tank being simulated (Pa) at the beginning of the
        simulation. The default value is 1E5. This parameter was made optional
        as the two-phase simulations did not require it to be filled, rather
        pytanksim will automatically calculate the saturation pressure given
        a starting temperature.

    final_time : float
        The time (seconds) at which the simulation is to be stopped.

    init_time : float, optional
        The time (seconds) at which the beginning of the simulation is set to.
        The default value is set to 0 seconds.

    displayed_points : int, optional
        The number of data points to be reported at the end of the simulation.
        The default is 200.

    target_temp : float, optional
        The target temperature (K) at which the simulation is to be stopped.
        The default value is 0, which effectively means the simulation
        does not have a set temperature at which the simulation is stopped.

    target_pres : float, optional
        The target pressure (Pa) at which the simulation is to be stopped.
        The default value is 0, which effectively means the simulation does
        not have a set pressure at which the simulation is stopped.

    stop_at_target_pressure : bool, optional
        If True, it will stop the simulation when the target pressure is met.
        The default is False.

    stop_at_target_temp : bool, optional
        If True, it will stop the simulation when the target temperature is
        met. The default is False.

    target_capacity : float, optional
        The amount of fluid (moles) stored in the tank at which the simulation
        is to be stopped. The default is 0.

    init_ng : float, optional
        The initial amount of gas (moles) stored in the tank at the beginning
        of the simulation. The default value is 0.

    init_nl : float, optional
        The initial amount of liquid (moles) stored in the tank at the
        beginning of the simulation. The default value is 0.

    init_q : float, optional
        The initial quality of the fluid being stored. It can vary between 0
        and 1. The default is None.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    inserted_amount : float, optional
        The amount of fluid which has been previously inserted into the tank
        (moles) at the beginning of the simulation. Used to track refueling
        processes across multiple simulations. The default value is 0.

    vented_amount : float, optional
        The amount of fluid which has been previously vented from the tank
        (moles) at the beginning of the simulation. Used to track discharging
        and boil-off processes across multiple simulations. The default value
        is 0.

    cooling_required : float, optional
        The cumulative amount of required cooling (J) to maintain a constant
        pressure prior to the start of a simulation. The default value is 0.
        Useful when restarting a stopped cooled refuel simulation.

    heating_required : float, optional
        The cumulative amount of required heating (J) to maintain a constant
        pressure prior to the start of a simulation. The default value is 0.
        Useful when restarting a stopped heated discharge simulation.

    vented_energy : float, optional
        Cumulative amount of enthaloy (J) contained in the fluid vented prior
        to the start of the simulation. The default is 0. Useful when
        stopping and restarting discharge simulations.

    flow_energy_in : float, optional
        Cumulative amount of enthalpy (J) contained in the fluid inserted
        prior to the start of the simulation. The default is 0. Useful when
        stopping and restarting refueling simulations.

    cooling_additional : float, optional
        The cumulative amount of user-specified cooling (J) prior to the start
        of a simulation. The default value is 0. Useful when stopping and
        restarting simulations with user-specified cooling.

    heating_additional : float, optional
        The cumulative amount of user-specified cooling (J) prior to the start
        of a simulation. The default value is 0. Useful when stopping and
        restarting simulations with user-specified heating.

    heat_leak_in : float, optional
        The cumulative amount of heat (J) which has leaked into the tank prior
        to the start of a simulation. The default value is 0. Useful when
        stopping and restarting simulations involving heat leakage.

    verbose : bool, optional
        Whether or not the simulation will print out its progress bars and
        give a notification once it has finished. The default value is True.
