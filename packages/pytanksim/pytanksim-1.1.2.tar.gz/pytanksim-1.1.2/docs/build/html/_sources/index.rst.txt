Welcome to pytanksim's documentation!

pytanksim is a package which calculates the mass and energy balances in fluid storage tanks and simulates the dynamics during processes such as refueling, discharging, dormancy, and boil-off.

It is also equipped to fit gas adsorption data on nanoporous materials to adsorption models, which then allows the inclusion of sorbent materials in the dynamic simulation.

This documentation page provides API information for each publicly accessible function, class, and method in pytanksim. Detailed case studies which serve as tutorials are available in the form of an article published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, which will be linked here once it is available.

Getting Started
===============

Dependencies
------------
The installation of pytanksim requires:

* python versions 3.7 and above
* CoolProp
* pandas 
* numpy>=1.6.1
* scipy
* tqdm
* assimulo>=3.0
* matplotlib

Installation 
------------

Pytanksim is listed on PyPI, so it should be possible in theory to install it with a single command via pip. Unfortunately, one of its dependencies, assimulo, tend to cause issues if one were to try installing pytanksim directly via pip, since the PyPI version of assimulo is not up to date and seems to be broken for newer versions of python, therefore causing pytanksim's install to fail. However, the build of assimulo on Anaconda seems to be well-maintained and working fine.

Thus, the easiest way to get pytanksim running if you don't have python installed on your computer, is to install python via `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com>`_ or `Miniconda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_. In Anaconda or Miniconda, you can create a virtual environment that contains python version 3.7 using the following command on the Anaconda prompter (just change the myenv name to whatever you want to name your working environment):

:: 

	conda create -n myenv python=3.7 

Then, activate this new virtual environment.

::

	conda activate myenv

You can then write the following to install a working version of assimulo in this virtual environment:

::

	conda install conda-forge::assimulo

Finally, you can install pytanksim to this virtual environment.

::


	pip install pytanksim

You should be able to use pytanksim in this virtual environment after this!

If you need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), you need to install the IDE through Anaconda within the virtual environment as well. For more information on how to work with virtual environments via Anaconda, you may want to see the `Anaconda website <https://docs.anaconda.com/working-with-conda/environments/>`_.

As an alternative to working with Anaconda, you may also install assimulo directly from `the source <https://github.com/modelon-community/Assimulo/blob/master/INSTALL>`_ and then you can pip install pytanksim without having to use a virtual environment, but that process is generally more involved.
