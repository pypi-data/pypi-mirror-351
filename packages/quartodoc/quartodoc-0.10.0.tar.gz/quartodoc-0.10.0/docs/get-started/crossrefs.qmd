## Linking by path

You can use [quarto's markdown linking syntax](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html#links-images)
to link to function docs, by using the path to the generated documentation file.

Here are some examples:

| code | result |
| ---- | ------ |
| ``[get_object](/reference/get_object.qmd)`` | [get_object](/reference/get_object.qmd) |
| ``[link text](/reference/MdRenderer.qmd)`` | [link text](/reference/MdRenderer.qmd) |


## Linking by function name

Use quartodoc's [interlinking filter](./interlinks.qmd) to link to functions using only their names:

| code | result |
| ---- | ------ |
| ``[](`quartodoc.get_object`)`` | [](`quartodoc.get_object`) |

Notice that the link above puts the function name in backticks, rather than using
the path to its documentation: `` `quartodoc.get_object` ``.

You can also use this approach to link to other documentation sites.
For example, including links to quartodoc, or https://docs.python.org/3 using function names.

See the [interlinks documentation](./interlinks.qmd) for set up and usage.


## The "See Also" section

A major goal of quartodoc is to automatically turn text in the "See Also" section
of docstrings into links.

See [this issue](https://github.com/machow/quartodoc/issues/21) for more details
on parsing See Also sections, and [this issue](https://github.com/machow/quartodoc/issues/22)
on turning type annotations into links.

## Type annotations in docstrings

This is planned, but currently unimplemented. See [this issue](https://github.com/machow/quartodoc/issues/22)
on turning type annotations into links.
