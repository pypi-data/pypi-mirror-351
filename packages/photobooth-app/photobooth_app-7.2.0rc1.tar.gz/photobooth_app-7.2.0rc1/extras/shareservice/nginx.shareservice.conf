# nginx.shareservice.conf
#
# Description:
# This Nginx configuration file is designed to serve a shareservice web application
# The configuration also includes a secondary server block to redirect all HTTP traffic 
# to HTTPS using Let's Encrypt, ensuring that all communications are encrypted.

# Primary server block serving the application
server {
    # The domain name for this server
    server_name example.com;
    
    # Limit the maximum size of a client request body to 50M
    client_max_body_size 50M;
    
    # The root directory for serving files
    root /var/www/html/shareservice;
    
    # The default file to serve if no file is specified in the URL
    index index.php;

    # Main location block - handles all requests to the root URL
    location / {
        # Try to serve the file requested, if it doesn't exist, try a directory
        # If neither exist, fallback to serving /index.php with the request arguments
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;
    }

    # PHP file handling
    location ~ \.php$ {
        # Include the standard FastCGI configuration settings for PHP
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;

        # Define the socket for PHP-FPM to handle PHP requests
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock;

        # Set the timeout for FastCGI requests (adjust as needed)
        fastcgi_read_timeout 500;
        
        # Uncomment to disable FastCGI buffering (optional)
        # fastcgi_buffering off;
    }

    # Deny access to any .htaccess files
    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }

    # Define the error log location for this server block
    error_log /var/log/nginx/shareservice.error.log;

    # Define the access log location for this server block
    access_log /var/log/nginx/shareservice.access.log;

    # Enable SSL on port 443 (IPv6 and IPv4)
    listen [::]:443 ssl;
    listen 443 ssl;

    # Specify the SSL certificate and key files for HTTPS
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;

    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;

    # Specify the Diffie-Hellman parameter for additional security
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;

# Secondary server block to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS
server {
    # Redirect to HTTPS if the host matches the server_name
    if ($host = example.com) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }

    # Listen on port 80 (HTTP) for IPv6 and IPv4
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;

    # The domain name for this server block (must match the server_name above)
    server_name example.com;

    # Return a 404 error if accessed directly without redirection
    return 404;
