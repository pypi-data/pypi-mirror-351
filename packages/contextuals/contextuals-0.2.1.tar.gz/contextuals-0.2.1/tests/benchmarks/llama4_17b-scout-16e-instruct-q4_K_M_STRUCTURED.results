Q6: When would be the best time to schedule a video call with someone in New York today?
Response Time: 10.90s
Answer: To determine the best time for a video call with someone in New York, let's consider their time zone. New York is in the Eastern Time Zone (ET), which is 6 hours behind Paris, where you are.

Given that it's 9:51 AM in Paris, that would be 3:51 AM ET. 

Considering most people prefer to have meetings or calls during their working hours, I would suggest scheduling the call for later in the day. A good time could be around 10:00 AM or 2:00 PM ET. 

Converting these times to Paris time: 
- 10:00 AM ET would be 4:00 PM in Paris
- 2:00 PM ET would be 8:00 PM in Paris

So, 4:00 PM or 8:00 PM Paris time would be suitable for a video call with someone in New York.
