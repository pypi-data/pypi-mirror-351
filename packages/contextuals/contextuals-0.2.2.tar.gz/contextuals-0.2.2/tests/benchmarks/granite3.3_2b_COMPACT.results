Q1: What should I wear outside today?
Response Time: 1.50s
Answer: Considering it's a New Moon and overcast with 79% humidity, slightly chilly (14.04°C), and probably wind from the west-southwest at around 20.376 km/h, you should likely dress in layers to accommodate changing temperatures throughout the day. A warm sweater or cardigan paired with a waterproof jacket would be advisable to shield against any potential light rain. Also, considering the West-Southwest wind might bring cooler air later in the day, it's a good idea to have an extra clothing layer on hand if needed. Remember, staying comfortable is key for exploring Paris today!

Q5: My computer feels slow. What might be causing this based on my current system?
Response Time: 3.23s
Answer: Your Mac running macOS 15.3.1-arm64, with an Apple M4 Max chip and 6GB of RAM, should generally be a fairly snappy machine. However, if you're experiencing slowness, several factors could be contributing:

1. **Running Out of Memory:** Even though your Mac has 6GB of RAM, multiple applications running in the background can consume available memory, slowing things down. Closing unnecessary apps could help improve performance.
   
2. **Insufficient Disk Space:** With a 193GB free space out of a total 1858GB, there's some room before you'll encounter issues. However, if you're low on disk space, it can cause applications to run slower due to the inability to store temporary data efficiently.

3. **Software Updates:** Although macOS updates often include performance enhancements, sometimes older system software or plugins might be a bottleneck. Make sure your system and applications are up-to-date.

4. **Resource Intensive Processes:** Specific tasks like heavy photo/video editing, 3D modeling, or complex data analysis can put significant demands on your processor (Apple M4). 

5. **Background Services:** Some apps run background services that consume CPU and network resources. You might want to investigate if any of these could be improved or reduced in their scope.

6. **Overheating:** Prolonged periods of high CPU usage can cause your Mac's fan to spin faster, potentially leading to thermal throttling (reduced performance for cooling). Ensure your device isn't overheating unnecessarily.

If you've tried all these and the slowness persists, consider running a system diagnostic tool like Activity Monitor or Disk Utility to pinpoint any specific issues with processes or storage health.

Q7: Should I open my windows right now for fresh air?
Response Time: 1.38s
Answer: While Paris is experiencing overcast weather conditions with 79% humidity today and a slight breeze from the west-southwest at 20.376 km/h, it's typically not advisable to fully open your windows during such conditions due to potential indoor air quality concerns. Consider checking outdoor air quality index (AQI) levels before making a decision. The current AQI is fair at 2. However, if you're feeling the brisk breeze or just looking for some change of scent as per recent weather news in Paris, a gentle opening could be beneficial. Nevertheless, it's always a good idea to balance this with indoor air hygiene precautions, particularly when pollen counts are high.

Q10: When is the golden hour for photography today?
Response Time: 1.76s
Answer: The golden hour, or "golden hour," occurs a short time after sunrise and a short time before sunset, during which the sunlight is soft, warm, and offers long shadows – making it ideal for photography. Today in Paris (48.86°N, 2.35°E), given a typical European springtime scenario around May 27th, if you're currently looking at this information around 9:15 AM CEST on the same day, sunrise was approximately two hours ago. Hence, "golden hour" would be ongoing now until approximately just before sunset, which will likely be around 8:00 PM CEST today. As it's still quite early in the morning at this time (9:15 AM), we're generally in the early part of the golden hour if it has already started after sunrise. Always check with a local lunar calendar and solar clock for precise times based on your geographic location.
