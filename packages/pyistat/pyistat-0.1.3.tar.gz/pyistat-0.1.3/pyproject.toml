description = "Pyistat is a friendly module made to easily allow anyone to use Python to search and get datasets from ISTAT APIs. There are two modules: the \"search\" module is used to find datasets and gives all the information needed to build a request URL. The \"get\" module is used to get data after helping you properly setup the dimensions (the keys, as called by ISTAT). This module was created because I found the lack of documentation by ISTAT frustrating."
