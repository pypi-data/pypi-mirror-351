A **cybersecurity framework** designed for **behavioral profiling** and **analysis of ransomware**. This tool helps security researchers and analysts understand ransomware behavior, detect anomalies, and develop mitigation strategies in a controlled environment.

---

## **Features**
- **Behavioral Profiling**: Monitor and analyze ransomware actions, such as file system changes, network activity, and process manipulation.
- **Threat Detection**: Detect suspicious activities using customizable rules and patterns.
- **Alerting System**: Generate alerts for detected threats and anomalies.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable with custom monitoring and analysis modules.
- **Safe Execution**: Execute ransomware samples in a controlled, isolated environment.

## **Installation**

You can install the framework using `pip`:

```bash
pip install rbprof
```

---

## **Usage**

### **1. Basic Setup**
Import the framework and initialize the components:

```python
from rbprof import CybersecurityFramework

# Initialize the framework
framework = CybersecurityFramework()

# Run the framework
framework.run()
```

---

### **2. Customizing Monitoring**
Add custom data sources or monitoring tools:

```python
from rbprof import Monitor, DataSource

# Create a custom data source
class CustomDataSource(DataSource):
    def get_data(self):
        return [
            {"timestamp": time.time(), "user": "admin", "action": "login"},
            {"timestamp": time.time(), "user": "attacker", "action": "brute_force"},
        ]

# Initialize the framework with a custom data source
custom_data_source = CustomDataSource()
monitor = Monitor(custom_data_source)
framework = CybersecurityFramework(monitor=monitor)
framework.run()
```

---

### **3. Adding Detection Rules**
Define custom threat detection rules:

```python
from rbprof import Detector

# Create a custom detector
class CustomDetector(Detector):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.threat_rules.append(
            {"action": "unauthorized_access", "description": "Unauthorized access detected"}
        )

# Initialize the framework with a custom detector
detector = CustomDetector()
framework = CybersecurityFramework(detector=detector)
framework.run()
```

---

### **4. Analyzing Behavior**
Extend the behavioral analysis engine:

```python
from rbprof import BehaviorEngine

# Create a custom behavioral engine
class CustomBehavioralEngine(BehaviorEngine):
    def analyze_behavior(self, data):
        anomalies = []
        for entry in data:
            if entry.get("action") == "suspicious_action":
                anomalies.append(entry)
        return anomalies

# Initialize the framework with a custom behavioral engine
behavioral_engine = CustomBehavioralEngine()
framework = CybersecurityFramework(behavioral_engine=behavioral_engine)
framework.run()
```

---

### **Example Output**

When you run the framework, it will log detected anomalies and threats:

```
2023-10-10 12:00:00 - INFO - Data collected for analysis.
2023-10-10 12:00:01 - INFO - Behavioral anomalies detected: [{'user': 'attacker', 'action': 'brute_force'}]
2023-10-10 12:00:02 - WARNING - ALERT: Threat detected: Potential brute force attack
```
