# Panther: Faster & Cheaper Computations with RandNLA

## Getting Started

This guide explains how to build and run the Panther codebase, including the native backend (`pawX`), and how to generate a Python wheel for distribution.

---

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.12+**: Panther is compatible with Python 3.12 and later.
- **Poetry** for dependency management
- **C++ Compiler**: GCC on Linux, MSVC on Windows
- **CUDA Toolkit**: For GPU acceleration, ensure you have the CUDA toolkit installed to compile .cu files requiring NVIDIA C Compiler (nvcc).

## Quick Start (Install & Use)

You can quickly install Panther using the powershell and Makefile scripts provided. This will set up the Python package and build the native backend.
Note: This sets up a venv environment, installs poetry, install dependencies, and builds the native backend.

### On Windows
1. **Open PowerShell** and run the following command:

    ```powershell
    .\install.ps1
    ```
### On Linux/macOS
1. **Open Terminal** and run the following command:

    ```bash
    make install
    ```
---

## Manual Setup (Optional)
If you prefer to set up Panther manually, follow these steps:

### Installing Dependencies

To install Python dependencies, run:

```bash
poetry install
```

This will set up a virtual environment and install all required packages.

### Building the Native Backend (`pawX`)

#### On Linux

1. **Install Required System Libraries**

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install liblapacke-dev
    ```

2. **Build and Install `pawX`**

    ```sh
    cd pawX
    make all
    ```

3. Confirm that `pawX.*.so` appears in the `pawX/` directory.

#### On Windows

1. **Build and Install `pawX`**

   ```powershell
    cd pawX
   .\build.ps1
   ```

2. Confirm that `pawX.*.pyd` appears in `pawX\` directory.

## Running Panther
To use panther in your python code, simply import the package:

```python
import torch
import panther as pr
# Example usage
A = torch.randn(1000, 1000)
Q, R, J = pr.linalg.cqrrpt(A)
print(Q.shape, R.shape, J.shape)
```

## Running Tests

Ensure your native backend is built and your Python environment is active. Then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/
```

This will execute unit tests and any Jupyter-based benchmarks.

---

## Generating Documentation (Optional)

Panther uses Sphinx for API docs located in `docs/`. To rebuild HTML docs:

```bash
cd docs
# On Windows:
.\make.bat clean
.\make.bat html
# On Linux/macOS:
make clean
make html
```

Open `docs/_build/html/index.html` in your browser.

---

## Building a Python Wheel (Optional)

Create a distributable wheel file:

```bash
poetry build
```

Find the resulting `.whl` under `dist/`.

## Pre-commit Hooks (Optional)

To enforce code style and formatting, install pre-commit hooks:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit install
```
