                        Not implemented yet thinking of implementing file io as a combination of the 
                        ThreadPool mechainism and the O_DIrect Dma mechainism in linux kernel 

                        we also thought of using new asyncronous IO mechainism known as linux kernel 


                        to make this cross platform we will be using a linux IO asyncronous mechainsm for linux (obiously)
                        and right now thread pool mechainism for windows and other OS 

                        !!!!!
