This repository contains a pure-python implementation of the Android
ADB and Fastboot protocols, using libusb1 for USB communications.

Additionally, support for specific OEM commands were added, including Nokia, 
Motorola, and Xiaomi.

This is a complete replacement and rearchitecture of the Android
project's fastboot code available at
https://github.com/android/platform_system_core/tree/master/adb

This code is mainly targeted to users that need to communicate with
Android devices in an automated fashion, such as in automated
testing.
