`OptiDamTool` is a Python package designed for analytics and decision-making in dam operations and water resources management. Conceptualized and released on May 29, 2025, the package offers tools for modeling and analyzing hydrological flow across a network of connected dams.


Leveraging functionalities from the open-source [GeoAnalyze](https://github.com/debpal/GeoAnalyze) package, `OptiDamTool` provides classes that help users prepare inputs for simulating water erosion and sediment transport, and support decision-making in dam network deployment for environmental sustainability.

## Classes

The following classes are included in the package:

- `OptiDamTool.WatemSedem`: Provides methods to prepare inputs for the
[WaTEM/SEDEM](https://github.com/watem-sedem) model, which predicts soil erosion, sediment transport capacity, and sediment delivery to stream networks at a watershed scale. While no methods have been implemented yet, development is currently underway.


- `OptiDamTool.Network`: Offers methods for establishing network connectivity between dams based on stream networks and hydrological flow paths.


## Features

The classes provide the following features:


### *Dam Network*

- Identification of connectivity between adjacent upstream and downstream dams


## Easy Installation

To install, use pip:

```bash
pip install OptiDamTool
```


## Quickstart
A brief example of how to start:

```python
>>> import OptiDamTool
>>> network = OptiDamTool.Network()
```


## Documentation
