snowfuse is a security-focused Python library built on top of FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) that 
enables developers to mount and freeze file systems in a controlled, read-only state. Designed 
for incident response, forensics, or containment scenarios, snowfuse allows sensitive or 
compromised systems to remain operable while preventing further modification of critical files or directories.
