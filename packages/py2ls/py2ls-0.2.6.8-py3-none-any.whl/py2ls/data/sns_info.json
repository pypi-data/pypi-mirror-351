        "A figure-level function for creating scatter plots and line plots. It combines the functionality of scatterplot and lineplot.",
        "A function for creating scatter plots, useful for visualizing the relationship between two continuous variables.",
        "A function for drawing line plots, often used to visualize trends over time or ordered categories.",
        "A figure-level function for creating linear model plots, combining regression lines with scatter plots.",
        "A figure-level function for creating categorical plots, which can display various types of plots like box plots, violin plots, and bar plots in one function.",
        "A function for creating a scatter plot where one of the variables is categorical, helping visualize distribution along a categorical axis.",
        "A function for creating box plots, which summarize the distribution of a continuous variable based on a categorical variable.",
        "A function for creating violin plots, which combine box plots and KDEs to visualize the distribution of data.",
        "A function for creating boxen plots, an enhanced version of box plots that better represent data distributions with more quantiles.",
        "A function for creating point plots, which show the mean (or another estimator) of a variable for each level of a categorical variable.",
        "A function for creating bar plots, which represent the mean (or other estimators) of a variable with bars, typically used with categorical data.",
        "A function for creating count plots, which show the counts of observations in each categorical bin.",
        "A figure-level function that creates distribution plots. It can visualize histograms, KDEs, and ECDFs, making it versatile for analyzing the distribution of data.",
        "A function for creating histograms, useful for showing the frequency distribution of a continuous variable.",
        "A function for creating kernel density estimate (KDE) plots, which visualize the probability density function of a continuous variable.",
        "A function for creating empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) plots, which show the proportion of observations below a certain value.",
        "A function that adds a rug plot to the axes, representing individual data points along an axis.",
        "A function for creating regression plots, which fit and visualize a regression model on scatter data.",
        "A function for creating residual plots, useful for diagnosing the fit of a regression model.",
        "A figure-level function that creates a grid of scatter plots for each pair of variables in a dataset, often used for exploratory data analysis.",
        "A figure-level function that combines scatter plots and histograms (or KDEs) to visualize the relationship between two variables and their distributions.",
        "Not a plot itself, but a function that allows you to change the context (style and scaling) of your plots to fit different publication requirements or visual preferences."
